Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,24 September 2017,TheOneThatYouWanted,10," What's wrong with you people? This was awesome!
","This film is freaking awesome, fun and a great time! Why in the heck does it have below a 6/10 on here? Are people seriously stupid enough to think that this piece of entertainment and satire is honestly depicting historical events in full or semi-full accuracy? What's wrong with you people? No really. Someone message me and explain the massive hate around this because I can not see what is wrong. This is pure fiction. Is there something disrespectful here that I am missing? Anyway, this is a fun piece of fiction with mostly great action, good acting and a great script. The film moves along nicely and there is never a dull moment. It is a 7/10 kind of film but I'm going to give it a 10/10 to offset the madness.",/review/rw2690391/?ref_=tt_urv
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,20 May 2021,EmmeCHammer,10," Gem, hidden that is
","I saw this movie when it first came out not in the theater, but on my HiDef 72inch brand spanking new TV. I avoided it in the theater because I said to myself that sounds like a stupidly named movie, but I do watch them all eventually on DVD or demand or some way or another, a movie addiction, a healthy addiction at that. Boy was I wrong I fell in love with this flick, and have seen it many many times and have it in my collection. It's cinematography, its acting, action, and story is great. I watched it this afternoon and thought I never reviewed it and gave it a 10 to help raise its rating a little, this is definitely not for everyone but for a great 2 hour ride of action and beautiful made movie its a hidden gem for me. Great cast and cuts no corners, don't be off put by the title, if you like vampire movies it's a must!",/review/rw2690391/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a Brit, my knowledge of Abraham Lincoln is limited to stovepipe hat and beard, the Civil War, abolition of slavery, and assassination at the theatre by John Wilkes Booth. I had absolutely no idea that he had enjoyed a career (prior to his entry into politics) as a vampire slayer, nor that there had been a large contingent of vampires within the Confederate army.

","Well, well, well, what a surprise. From the name ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" you might expect (as I did) some B grade movie where the name Abraham Lincoln was used to attract attention. And there are the reviews that speak absolute horror of this movie. But nothing would be more from the truth, this movie is a fantastic thrill ride with excellent directing, very, very good camera work en good acting. Even the CGI was incredible, there is a chase scene with horses that really blows your mind, not to mention the bridge scene. The movie is even historically correct at 56:38!!

Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) is not only a vampire hunter, but his life has been defined by vampires for a long time. His mother was killed by a vampire. As a young man, he tries to seek revenge but fails. But in the process, he meets Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who teaches him how to kill a vampire. During the Civil War as President of the United States, he comes to realize that vampires are fighting with the Confederate forces.

Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,23 June 2012,DoctorRabbit,8," A Fun Action Flick That Delivers On Exactly What It Promises
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is exactly what you would expect from the title. A ridiculous, over-the-top, and fun action-horror flick. The serious tone and silly premise may turn off some people, but the serious tone actually works to the films advantage and actually made the movie more fun. I actually think a goofy and comedic tone could've hurt the films in some ways by being a bit too tongue and cheek. The action scenes were well done and incredibly entertaining to watch. The final action scene was actually worth the price of admission alone. I also enjoyed how they included actual parts of Lincoln's history into the film. Benjamin Walker also surprisingly did a good job as Lincoln. The dialogue is corny but I actual think that played as a strength to a film rather than a weakness. The 3D effects are also used very well in the film and delivers a good mix of depth and gimmicky moments and really enhanced the action sequences. I would highly recommend seeing the film in 3D if you have the option. If I had any complaints it would be that I did feel like the film dragged a bit in the middle.",/review/rw2690391/?ref_=tt_urv
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,22 October 2012,udoricht,7," What did you expect to see more?
","If you take this movie so serious you'll be disappointed 'cause it's not. But if you take it as fun movie, fulled of action/fantasy/horror scenes and as what it is then you can give it a chance. Maybe, the character of Abraham Lincoln defined as vampire slayer is naive and childish and is not what you expected to see for historical important figure. Maybe someone thinks that this is disgrace for the character. And finally maybe someone thinks there is a storyline abstraction 'cause the book is better and I don't doubt that even I haven't read it. All this defects are not so important if you like movies in this kind of genre like Underworld, Resident Evil etc. This was a movie that deserves attention and give it a try.",/review/rw2690391/?ref_=tt_urv
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,28 November 2012,toqtaqiya2,8," A terrific action summer movie with a fresh visual style.
","After watching Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter at home I asked myself why I didn't go to see it in a movie theater during the summer. I should have but I guess the reason was that I thought the premise was silly. Too bad because this is a terrific action film. It's very entertaining but I stress that it's not dumb. All the actors deliver good performances. Benjamin Walker creates a fantastic hero in Abraham Lincoln, a secret vampire hunter and the 16th President of the United States. Walker is good in the action scenes as well as at delivering Lincoln's historic lines. He begins hunting vampires as a young man with the assistance of his mentor Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper). Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Lincoln's wife Mary Todd and Anthony Mackie plays his closest friend William Johnson. Rufus Sewell as Adam is the film's main antagonist, a powerful vampire with an interesting story. The film is based on Seth Grahame-Smith's mashup novel of the same name. It plays very much like a comic book movie, and it takes liberties with the facts of Lincoln's life while poking fun at some of them. Director Timur Bekmambetov has a talent for creating impressive visuals, but here with the assistance of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel the look of the film is often stunning. The scene in which Lincoln fights Jack Barts on horseback at sunset is just one amazing highlight. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter earned almost twice its budget at the box office but it should have been a bigger hit. It's serious fantasy horror. I won't be surprised if it becomes a cult movie. It's one of the best films of 2012, and I definitely recommend seeing it.",/review/rw2690391/?ref_=tt_urv
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,20 June 2012,aaronjbong,7," A Different Side of Abraham Lincoln
","When I discovered this movie, skepticism washed over me. I mean, Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter? Having one of the greatest presidents of all time as the character of a vampire hunter would be the last thing anyone would expect. When I entered the theater, my initial thought was that this movie would bring me disappointment. But it turned out to be much better than expected and a fun film filled with lots of violence, blood, gore, and vampire decapitations.",/review/rw2690391/?ref_=tt_urv
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,25 June 2012,Pumpkin_Man,8," What Your History Teacher Never Told You!!!
","This movie started off pretty slow, but got better toward the middle. It was a great blend of horror and political history. You can tell it's based on a graphic novel because of the often bright colors, slow-motion action fight scenes, and cgi gore, but it was still fun. When Abe Lincoln's mother is killed, he vows revenge against the man who did it. When he finds out the killer was a vampire, he's trained by Henry Sturgess to become a fearless vampire hunter. I like the last half of the movie better because Lincoln looks more like himself that we know with the beard. Will Lincoln be able to free the slaves, stop the war, and kill all the vampires during his Presidency? I'd definitely recommend ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER!!!",/review/rw2690391/?ref_=tt_urv

","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter sounds like a strange silly title. Some might find it stupid while some will find it peculiarly interesting. People would expect it as a ridiculously fun bloody action film starring one of America's greatest Presidents. Since it's directed by Timur Bekmambetov, one of the most insane action movie directors ever, it suppose to be enjoyably crazy throughout. The film is fun when Abe is killing vampires with his axe, but it gets really different to the biography moments. While everybody is expecting for some awesome ridiculousness, we instead get a lot of serious biography that would take a lot of time to get to the vampire killing.

Overall I was very impressed, having never read the book I did not really know what to expect. Acting was good, nothing Oscar worthy but no poor performances. Everyone did their job well, especially Benjamin Walker and Dominic Cooper. They both excelled in their roles as Lincoln and Henry respectively. Plot flowed well and was easy to follow, and the action was absolutely fantastic. It was over the top, fast paced, bloody, and very well done.

Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,18 October 2012,piranha-army,6," A different tale on the life of Abraham Lincoln.
","This movie was surprisingly entertaining, which I doubted when I saw the trailer. It begins slow but steadily gains speed throughout the film. Though it doesn't get as good as a good vampire film should, it offers a fictional story with a non-fictional setting and characters. Benjamin Walker gives a good performance as the president who believes in vampires. Dominic Cooper as Henry was OK but could of been better. Mary Elizabeth Winstead I believe was miscast in her role as Mary Todd, she was too young for me too believe her as an older Mary Todd. Other than that the film was generally entertaining if leading away to boring conversation parts. The fight scenes are done well and the weapon of choice: An Axe, which is well used in this film. If you like Abraham Lincoln and you like Vampires then you will love this movie!. Thanks for reading and enjoy the Film.",/review/rw2690391/?ref_=tt_urv

","I think this show is very good, the best show produced by Disney channel in a while actually. I like the idea of the two twins being complete opposites of each other and have to teach each other how to survive in each others company. I also think that is very clever that both twins are played by Dove Cameron, who by the way is an extremely talented singer and actress as she is able to play both Liv&Maddie who are both complete opposites. Disney hid the twin thing so well that for a while i thought they were played by 2 actual twins. I also like the other family members like joey, parker, the mom and the dad. I especially think the 2 parents are hilarious! However, the one thing i don't understand is that Liv,Maddie and the parents are all white but Joey is Mediterranean and Parker is Asian and there is no mention of them being adopted. The cast is: Dove Cameron as Liv&Maddie Rooney, Joey Bragg as Joey Parker, Tenzing Trainor as Parker Rooney, Kali Roacha as Karen Rooney and Benjamin King as the dad.",/review/rw4292634/?ref_=tt_urv

Liv and Maddie,22 May 2014,NewOCFan,10," Honestly the first Disney Channel show in years I actually enjoy
","Honestly, I don't get any of the hate I've seen with this show. There's a couple of small moments where at least one of the actors will overact in an episode but I don't notice it too much. What honestly interests me most about the show is Dove Cameron as both twins. I wish there could be more of a sisterly bond present in the show because I saw the first episode and I found myself really loving it. I loved how even though Liv is a star fresh out of Hollywood, she doesn't come back as someone over the top, filled with glamour and attitude. That's to be a bit expected and I understand that with other characters on TV that are like that. But I just love how surprisingly sweet she is and Maddie is alright too. Her catchphrase a little but too much but it thankfully hasn't gotten on my nerves yet. The twins are, of course, what make the show. Usually you can find the side characters to be better but I just find the stars of the show to actually be the most interesting. I've watched some of the episodes out of order but I still think it's good and has a few more funny moments and I feel like it should be given more of a chance. Just because the show is colorful and isn't some ""sitcom"" that's really a half an hour PSA, doesn't mean it's not good.",/review/rw4292634/?ref_=tt_urv

Liv and Maddie,31 July 2014,welovesamandcat,10," Best show on Disney with Girl Meets World basically
","This show is perfect. The lead is perfect. People are scared to give it credit when it's actually better than most Disney shows. Calling Austin & Ally good and saying this is bad is like calling Drake & Josh bad and saying Shake It Up was better. The lead is awesome and does a fantastic job at playing both twins and no one gives her enough credit for it. I'm glad she was nominated for a Teen Choice Award during the first season of her show. That goes to show she's actually talented. The last people who got that treatment was Bridgit and Demi. So Dove getting that nomination is Huge. The season finale was A+. I feel Disney is making it look bad by playing the parody video FROYO YOLO when Dove talents is more than that. That video was a joke and they make it look real. I see a bright future for this show and lead. I just wish haters would accept it. Disney shows were horrible when it was Ant Farm, Jessie DWAB, Austin & Ally, Shake It Up on the air. Now that Liv and Maddie, Girl Meets World and the Not so good but watchable I Didn't Do It is on air people still bash it. These shows aren't that bad, give the new projects Disney is working on a chance. Watch 5 episodes and get hooked. Liv and Maddie is easily to get hooked too. The lead is beautiful, can act and sing. She has a movie coming out with Jessica Alba and Samuel L Jackson and just got done filming what is to be said the next High School Musical. It was directed by Kenny the creator and director of High School Musical! I'm so ready to see Dove the lead get bigger and hope she wins her TCA. Liv and Maddie is awesome and I'll watch it over any Disney show today.

","One of the wittiest and most sophisticated movie satires of recent vintage, ""In the Loop"" provides us with a hilarious behind-the-scenes glimpse into the ugly, messy world of international diplomacy. The mad run-up to the Iraq war serves as the obvious blueprint for the fictional - yet far from make-believe - tale the writers have come up with here. We begin in London where news has just leaked out that the British and Americans are planning a military invasion of an unspecified country in the Middle East. When the bumbling Minister for International Development, Simon Foster, accidentally goes off script by stating in an interview that such a war is ""unforeseeable,"" the Prime Minister's staff goes into immediate damage control mode, hustling Foster off to Washington D.C. to see if they can get him in on the pre-war planning and negotiations. From that point on, Foster becomes a bone-of-contention between the pro-war and anti-war factions battling it out for preeminence.",/review/rw2209468/?ref_=tt_urv

The marketing materials were using the whole Obama silkscreen poster look and I really wasn't interested in a movie about how the US and Britain decided to go into the Middle East. But then the buzz started. The realization that the film was shot with a penchant for improv, a desire to entertain rather than teach, and a cast of characters looking as though they are in a Christopher Guest movie, soon turned that preconception around.

","One of the best political satirical comedies in years! 'In The Loop' is a spin-off (kind-of) of the fantastic British comedy 'The Thick of It', and follows Simon Foster (Tom Hollander), a Cabinet Minister who makes a series of unfortunate slip-ups, the first is when he tells an interviewer that he believes war (always referred to as the invasion or the war, but never Iraq or potentially Afghanistan) is ""unforeseeable"" before telling journalists under pressure that you have to conquer a mountain of conflict on the path of peace. These mistakes place him in the middle of a diplomatic mine-field as both, the anti-war constabulary led by General Miller (James Gandolfini) and the Assistant Secretary of Diplomacy Karen Clark (Mimi Kennedy), and the gung-ho supporter of war Linton Barwick (David Rasche) - so crazy he keeps a live grenade as a paperweight - want Simon as a transatlantic partner to support their cause. Should he put his conscience or his political career first?

","Armando Iannucci's brilliant political satire, 'The Thick Of It', takes obvious cues from real events (and personalities) in British politics; and cooks these ingredients into a splendidly toxic broth personified by the character of Maclolm Tucker, spin doctor extraordinaire, the man with the most inventive foulmouth on the planet. The other protagonists are slimy, incompetent, self-serving; but part of Iannucci's genius is that even as you hate them, you almost end up feeling sorry for them as well, doomed to play their part in the political machine. It's a brilliant programme; what's even more unusual is the success of its adaptation to the big screen. To make 'In the Loop', Iannucci has directly addressed one of the biggest recent political stories, the second Gulf War, which also allows him to introduce a range of American archetypes into his drama; as with his British characters, the mixture of exaggeration, subtlety and sheer venality in their portrayals is wonderfully judged. And although wholly fictional, as an account of how certain intelligence dossiers came to be faked, it's also wholly compelling and believable. Less surprisingly, many of the regular cast from the TV series also feature in the film, although (Peter Capaldi as Tucker aside) in slightly different roles. But there's no denying the basic quality of the humour here; the title of this review, incidentally, is one character's description of opera.

In The Loop aims at making sure they scrutinize the bureaucratic desk jocks for all their worth. The film follows the Minister of International Development (Tom Hollander) after he has put his foot in his mouth, unintentionally announcing that war is unforeseeable. Back tracking and word-smith manipulations prove mute, fortunately for the Minister he's got big fans in the US who would like nothing more then to use the naive Brit in their political posturing.

A lot of movies have tried and a lot have failed, although there were the lucky few that passed the bar (Election, Thank You for Smoking) but the brilliant thing about In The Loop is that it's so stupidly funny that it's one of the best comedies of the 21st Century! Armando Iannucci, most known for his The Thick of It series in the UK, directs a movie with the a the familiar theme of The Office. That documentary-style of film-making can be hit-or-miss (most recently, Public Enemies, a miss) and Iannucci hits it right on. Every scene he graces with a camera comes out picture perfect; nobody could've pegged this movie any better. Iannucci, Jesse Armstrong, Tony Roche and Simon Blackwell's script is something out of picture show heaven and sounds like it must've taken forever to finish, edit, revise, etc. Although these guys, these geniuses, apparently know what they're doing and don't care what anybody else says. That is the heart and soul of movie-making, readers. In The Loop is about a corrupt British government that accidentally gets the country thrown into the middle of a war. Loop stars Peter Capaldi, Gina McKee, James Gandolfini, Chris Addison and there's even a whimsical cameo by Steve Coogan. Capaldi is the absolute best at what he did, spewing swears as coarse as they are a riot (""fuck you, you lubricated horse cock!"") and freaking out.

In The Loop is the story of Simon Foster (played excellently by Tom Hollander), a politician who says war is unforeseeable, and is forced to resolve the problem, going as far as having to travel from London to Washington. With the help of his assistant, Toby (Chris Addison), he does his best to resolve the problem. James Gandolfini, an excellent actor, is amusing here as Lt. Gen. George Miller.

Blackhat,16 January 2015,trublu215,5," Blackhat is not only disappointing, its embarrassing
","Blackhat is the latest from maverick director Michael Mann...it also happens to be his worst film ever. Yes, I am even factoring in The Keep. It is THAT bad. Starring Chris Hemsworth and Viola Davis, this film is a misfire and criminally misuses a talented cast and a talented crew. Nick is a furloughed convict trying to nail a destructive hacker who is damaging the financial stabilities of countries all around the world. Now, on the list of people better suited for this role, Chris Hemsworth shouldn't even be on this list. Watching him as a hacker is as painful as watching Adam Sandler in drag seduce Al Pacino. Working off a screenplay from Morgan Davis Foehl, Mann seems to focus more on having the shakiest hand-held cinematography not in a Paranormal Activity film than actually telling a coherent story with good characters. And for those of you who were expecting Michael Mann to deliver a film like Heat or The Insider, you will walk away from this thoroughly disappointed. The action is short, rare and very tame while the scenes that are attempting to explain what the hell is going on are so convoluted, long and boring that it creates a very uneven film that borders unwatchable. One of the biggest gripes I have with this film is the cinematography. It is entirely too shaky for a film like this and, on a serious note, reminded me more of End of Watch. While that style fit End of Watch perfectly, it doesn't fit this film. It doesn't make it look gritty, it just makes it look painfully under-produced and underfunded. Overall, Mann's Blackhat serves as one of the biggest disappointments in recent memory considering the fact this is Michael Mann we're talking about here...the guy who did Heat, Thief and Collateral. Unfortunately, if this is the best Mann has to offer, I fear it is only going to get worse as time goes on. Blackhat is underdeveloped, unrealistic, and filmed terribly.

This movie dares to be different, it dares to be slow paced, watching it is like reading a book, it actually requires a mental effort on the part of the viewer to keep track of what's going on and naturally people these days don't like that.

If you like Michael Mann I promise you WILL like this. OK, it's not a break-neck furious ride, but was Collateral? OK, it might not have the depth and characterisation of Heat, but come on, that had Pacino and DeNiro! OK, it is not full of headline villains and massive weapons like maybe your average super hero movie, but come on, they are generally dreadful popcorn fodder anyway! What this does have however is everything you want from Michael Mann; cinematography, soundtrack, those amazing cityscapes, the personal camera angles that Mann uses without comparison, and 3 excellent lead actors. A lot of criticism has been aimed at Chris Hemsworth, but without HIS portrayal, the relationship with Wei Tang would not be credible, and ergo the movie wold not carry. Their relationship is key and it brings the same intense feeling that DeNiro had with Amy Brenneman, and Colin Farrell with Li Gong in Miami Vice; right from that first cab-ride I was sold on his feelings towards her.

","Drenched in rainbow colors and featuring multiple training montages scored to Green Day and Blink 182 (including a Busby Berkeley-inspired synchronized stretching sequence), Stick It assumes an insolent air while thoroughly adhering to countless clichés, from the bitchy adversary (Vanessa Lengies's Joanne) who ultimately joins forces with Haley, to the superfluous comedic relief characters (played by Kellan Lutz and John Patrick Amedori), to the eventual triumph achieved via the girls' decision to reject their manipulative parents and be themselves. That the film tries too hard to strike a hardcore pose is epitomized by Peregrym, whose charisma as Haleya sweet Skittle masquerading as a Sour Patch Kidis often undercut by her strained efforts to behave simultaneously cute, bratty, and tough.",/review/rw1354258/?ref_=tt_urv

","Stick It is a rebellion film for a new generation. I don't mean to imply that it's some sort of classic but young people, teenagers, girls and guys will probably gravitate to it as the type of film Rocky, or Karate Kid was many years ago. It's about over coming fear, it's about bettering yourself, and it's about fighting for what you believe in and sticking it to those who try to stop you. It is rebellion. In her directorial debut writer and director Jessica Bendinger captures that spirit very well. The film follows a fairly predictable recipe but at the same time doesn't quite hit the mark like other films in the same genre. Bendinger who also wrote the teen smash Bring It On, which was brilliantly satirical, and funny, and ridiculous and yet encouraging all at once, tries to give that spirit to Stick It but somehow doesn't quite pull it off.",/review/rw1354258/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the London Film Festival's handful of world premieres, The Falling had naturally generated buzz as it's a film funded by the BFI, which is quite unusual for them. Unfortunately, while it has its merits, it doesn't quite live up to expectation as a whole. That said, the limited budget is impressively spread out with a solid cast including Game of Thrones' Maisie Williams and convincing 1960s production and costume design. The creativity of director/writer Carol Morley is less striking. It's a film interested in starting a lot of tangents without finishing them, or instead giving us underwhelming payoffs.

It's a nice concept, but the film seems too obviously sympathetic to the girls, without really letting us inside their heads. Oddly, they don't seem to be so freaked out by their condition. Also, the soundtrack is absurdly intrusive, and deflates rather than enhances the natural atmosphere. And there's just a little too much in the way of extraneous plot - budding sexuality, a troubled mother - daughter relationship - to truly build the sense of claustrophobia which would be needed to make the film a success.

It tries to be confrontational in its treatment of female coming of age but has created a vacuous surface-deep depiction that offers girls up as wan little nail-chewing nothings fit for being looked at only, preferably in school uniform. Script dismal, acting heroic considering this. Ghostly recaps of dialogue from five minutes earlier in the film show the director's underestimation of her audience, which might explain why all other elements of theme and plot are equally heavy handed.

The game genuinely gave me a Guardians vibe, with the music playing in the background during combat and the way the team just speaks and interacts with each other, the ridiculous messes they get in and the ridiculous way they each have their own solutions to it was very much like the Guardians. Arguments felt genuine to their characters and not out of the blue. The way the characters look, when I saw the trailers and I told myself I hated it. I thought they messed it up just like The Avengers but when I started playing my first thought wasn't, ""it's not that bad"", it was ""wow it actually looks really good"". I love their character designs. I only have one thing that I don't like and it's that the characters can be stiff during cutscenes or dialogue sometimes and the animation just looks a bit awkward but this didn't degrade my enjoyment of the game at all, still a 10/10 for me.

The script is intelligent, and contains a truth that isn't found in most ""off-beat"" crime films. In fact, the crimes in the film, while not without the importance to the story, is secondary to how these people are around one another, the courtesy, the un-said things, the mishaps, and the truths.

","""Sydney"" is the first film from director Paul Thomas Anderson better known as the director of ""Boogie Nights"", this years loathed and loved ""Magnolia"" and several Fiona Apple videos. This film is essentially about a man who seems to pick up kids off the street (John C. Reilly, Gwyneth Paltrow) and teach them the ways of the casino and gambling and helps them out. Sydney knows everything about everything, the man is flawless, or is he? Paltrow is good as a waitress who just can't stop prostituing herself. Reilly is funny and sweet as John the serrogant son of Sydney. Jackson is slimey, sleazy and somehow likeable as only Jackson can be. And of course Philip Baker Hall as Sydney is amazing. ""Sydney"" is merely a taste of what was to come from this young director. There are some long steadicam shots and there is the funny, Tarantinoish (minus much of the swearing and less pop culture references) dialogue. Anderson knows how to use a camera and editing to their full effect and make a scene that could be boring if directed by anyone else, exciting. Look for cameos from many future Andersonites (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Robert Ridgely) The film is a cut above most crime thrillers, this one is more light hearted (for a crime movie, it's not light hearted for say a romantic comedy, no no :), funny and even touching in some parts. If you are a fan of Anderson rent this, see how he has  increased his creativity and grown on his talents since this film. If you are not a fan of Anderson rent this, cause if the things you didn't like about Magnolia were the long running time and some pointless steadicam shots, you'll be happy to see this one is little over 1 hour 40 min and only has several long steadicam shots that are used for a reason.

Of course they'll never make it: once a loser, always a loser. But Sydney still has to try. The claustrophobic, rip-off world of casinos, anonymous 'luxury' hotels, sleazy motels, is superbly portrayed. Surely, after watching this film, nobody would ever want to visit Vegas. Paltrow is brilliant as the whore with zero self-esteem, ready to destroy her chance of a new start for the sake of 300 bucks; money is the only way of validating her self-destructive promiscuity. Samuel Jackson swaggers through the role of Satan as if born to it. The only jarring note, preventing this one getting a 9/10, is the stuff about Sydney wanting to atone for shooting the young guy's father.

","Perhaps it's unsurprising that Paul Thomas Anderson's often overlooked first film is a meandering, coincidence-conscious neo-noir. 'Hard Eight (1996)' clearly shares the same DNA as much of the now well-renowned director's work, particularly 'Magnolia (1999)' and 'Boogie Nights (1997)'. In some ways, the piece doesn't really seem to be about anything. However, it's primarily a character-study of Philip Baker Hall's somewhat enigmatic Sydney and, as such, has more than enough substance to keep you engaged throughout. The plot does come in distinct chunks but it's delivered at a decent pace and it's never predictable. The chemistry between the two leads makes for some endearingly entertaining sequences, with the 'fun' of the duo's gambling cheats being aptly conveyed. Things do begin to feel a little stale, but a twist shakes things up right when they're at their least interesting. After this, the flick piles subtle revelation on subtle revelation to make for an unconventionally exciting final act. It all gets a bit mysterious, in a way. You can't quite put your finger on what the climax is supposed to be saying; then again, it may not be saying anything at all. Overall, this is a solid first effort.

The movie Antz which actually came out before A Bug's Life by about a month takes the role of what ants do a lot more seriously and better captures an ant like atmosphere. The movie A Bug's Life really doesn't seem to understand what ants do or how their colonies work, but the movie Antz does it all. There are the miners, the warriors, the drones (the ones with wings) the queen and others. The voice acting itself is also pretty good and Woody Allen fits the role of Z perfectly.

I thoroughly recommend this movie, and the only criticism I have is that there are some scenes that young children might find frightening, like the fight between the ants and the big green bugs. The visuals are a delight, as well as the tightly-structured script.The story, while simple, is well-told, and is sensibly revolved around the life of Z, brilliantly voiced by Woody Allen. Sharon Stone was suitably feisty as Princess Bala, and Sylvester Stallone was a huge surprise as Weaver. Christopher Walken was also good, but it's the villain who steals the show, like Bug's Life. Gene Hackman's General was deliciously sinister, and quite complex, very similar to Kevin Spacey in Bug's Life(Hopper is SLIGHTLY better).

The film is endlessly hilarious, with tons of funny dialogue, quotable lines, and truly heartfelt moments. It's almost ironic that a film with such small creatures can be so massively entertaining, but Antz is incredibly easy to watch, and one that keeps you at the edge of your seat waiting to find what is next. It's been over 20 years since the films release, but it's still a relevant satire for today, and an animated style and honesty that I wish were still portrayed in more animated films today. The film can be crass when it wants to, with plenty of swears and some adult humor that would not be in the film were it to be released today, but is part of what it makes it so grand. Antz is a surprisingly honest, refreshing animated comedy that is truly unique, even with its comparisons to bugs life. It's humor may not always land, but it does so more than not, and when it does it truly brings its all- without ever seeming like too much. It's a touching tale, that is equally romantic as it is inspiring and heartfelt, and may just earn a place as one of my favorite animated comedies ever.

The ""z"" in the title regards individuality as a worker ant convinces a soldier ant to switch places so that he may experience adventure in the outside world but he is thrown into the midst of a termite war. Z emerges from hiding and is celebrated as a hero until his worker title is revealed. To avoid punishment he flees with the reluctant Princess. While typical, co-directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson highlight with excellent detail particularly during a picnic sequence where the Princess is concealed in bubblegum on the bottom of a shoe that clothes in upon Z. Z is voiced by Woody Allen complete with posturing and personality. Sharon Stone voices the Princess who is at first seen as a hostage until she realizes what Z is. Sylvester Stallone voices the good-hearted soldier ant who switched places with Z. Gene Hackman voices the villain and despite his talent the role is standard issue and too familiar. Christopher Walken appropriately voices a sniper ant doing the obvious. We know how this will end but it is the celebrity personalities that prevail.

Many of the comments here assert that Besson makes it clear that the Maid was simply mentally ill, yet I read the film as deeply ambivalent about what was going on. Were her visions the hallucinations of a schizophrenic? Were they given by God? What's the difference? More questions are asked: Why does an omnipotent, omniscient, all-compassionate deity allow terrible things to happen? What is the meaning of kingship - to own or to serve?

","We are already used to the original depictions Lus Besson did of humans on screen. How would he do with real events this time? I'm happy to say he suceeded. We are somewhat used to the regular ""automatic pilot"" depictions of Joan's life, the woman who loved god above all things and believed she was sent to save her people from the clutches of the British. But here we are entitled to a much more personal point of view: Besson's eye for Milla is particularly sensible, and we notice she as a particular shine no other character has. Therefore, we establish an empathy with her which starts even when she is only a child. The movie has a great period detail, and some incredible sequences, but, for some reason, it is the film by Besson that grabbed me the least, I can't explain why, although that isn't saying that I didn't like. In fact, I think there are things about this movie I haven't seen nowhere else, specially all the scenes where Joan hallucinates and has visions of God. This movie is totally different from all medieval adventures we have seen so far, and its shots are Luc Besson's own. The all-stellar cast helps a lot, and Dustin Hoffman turn out welcome at the end. The battle scenes are a wow!Thierry Arboghast's cinematography helps a lot to establish a cool look of medieval times, specially when fire is concerned. Eric Serra's score reaches depth levels he has never reached before. A great film altogether, which deserves to be seen with the heart willing to take whatever we get from it.

Further more, this was an Oscar performance from Milla Jovovich, but apparently the film wasn't even nominated (based on what I can see here on IMDb).  This film is in the category, `either you get it, or you don't', or `either you love it or hate it'.  I didn't know anything about Joan of Arc, and maybe that is why I liked it, watching it as a film rather then historical documentary.  The film leaves me with a comfortable feeling.  Before I watched it, I was afraid that we would see some saint of a woman, and how un-human and holy she was in what she did.  Instead we see a young woman, plagued with the notion of purpose, extreme determination, while never fully understanding why or what is happening.

Joan of Arc,14 August 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Not the greatest war movie, but a good movie, and a somewhat true-to-facts portrayal of Jeanne d'Arc
","Luc Besson usually makes spectacular movies; Leon, The Fifth Element, etc. Joan of Arc is no exception. It details the life of Jeanne, the maiden of Lorraine, who in and around the year 1431, helped France defeat England, and win a war that has lasted for almost an entire century. The plot is great, and it has a very good pace. I am almost never bored when watching this film, despite the fact that it's fairly long(about two and a half hours long), and I've seen it at least half a dozen times. What I've found to be great about the film is the re-watchable quality it has; I've seen it many times, yet I haven't grown tired of it. Up to the very end, it always has a scene or two that you can look forward to, either because it's exceptionally well done, has very good cinematography, has great acting and/or dialog, or every one of those qualities. The acting is great. Every single actor gives a great performance, even the child actors were convincing. The performances that impressed me the most, however, were those of Milla Jovovich and Dustin Hoffman, as Jeanne and her conscience, respectively. They never cease to amaze me. The characters were well-written and credible. I particularly liked the way Jeanne was written as having a very notable temper and being very decisive. I also very much enjoyed the various supporting characters, the best being La Hire and The Conscience. I liked the way the film seems to question Jeanne's sanity; whereas most believe that she *was* in fact, sent by God, this film sits down and asks the question, if she really was, or if the signs and miracles weren't all in her head, and caused by everyone wanting to believe it. The very last scenes especially puts doubt in the viewer. It was quite a gutsy move by Besson, to question his own country's hero. I will admit, the film does really make it seem more like she is crazy rather than sent by God, but it doesn't feel like Besson is pushing his view onto us, telling us that that's the way it was; it feels more like he tries to make us question it. The action and the war scenes were very well done, very chaotic and disturbing, very intense and bloody. This isn't the best war movie ever made, nor is it the most factually accurate; it might not even be the best retelling of the legend of Jeanne d'Arc. But I have found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted, well-choreographed, well-done film that makes you think. And that's good enough for me. Several scenes are quite memorable, as are some of the lines. All in all, a very enjoyable war-drama, with an authentic story and some well-done battle sequences. I recommend it to fans of the actors, of Luc Besson's other work and of war movies/dramas in general. Just don't expect a full-out war movie; it's two hours and thirty minutes long, and I don't think more than forty-five minutes in total are spent fighting. 7/10",/review/rw4435142/?ref_=tt_urv

The Black Dahlia,15 February 2007,Galina_movie_fan,9," Brian De Palma's vision of the most notorious unsolved mystery:
","I have only seen 16 movies released in 2006 and I think that ""The Black Dahlia"" (2006) directed by Brian De Palma is one of the most enjoyable. The way it walks, talks, sounds, and feels truly captivated me. It is a fantastic cinematic achievement. It is shocking, dark, very clever, and enormously beautiful. It is over the top but how would you make a movie about the investigation of the most notorious and gruesome never solved murder in Hollywood differently? I like this exploitative, overplayed, smoldering, overwhelming, cheesy, campy Crime / Drama / Mystery / Thriller (my favorite genres) with the evident elements of black comedy (the most favorite genre when it's done well). I don't deny that it has its problems but I still believe it is worth watching and rewatching, especially on DVD when you can stop it and return to the earlier scene to see what you might have missed the first time. ""The Black Dahlia"" is one of the rare films that make you forget all their flaws. I am still puzzled with the ending but I LOVE the movie; I could not take my eyes off the screen. The way De Palma uses light, shadows, his combination of colors, black and gold - my favorite, his use of stairways, and the way we first are allowed to notice the body - it is Art, noir film made by an Artist. Besides, I simply can't be indifferent to a movie that uses Cole Porter 's song ""Love for Sale"" which I adore as performed by k.d. lang.",/review/rw1476495/?ref_=tt_urv

At times he looks as confused as I did and just as annoyed. Who can blame him? Hilary Swank, what was she doing? She looked like Vampyra's sister, the boring one. What a catastrophic piece of casting. And Fiona Shaw? If the film had been all like her performance the flick could have had a chance at the campiest ""noire"" ever put on film ever.

Perhaps what this film needed was a single producer, director, writer team that could focus on the story. And how about that acting?

","Despite its po-faced earnestness and basis on real-life events, THE BLACK DAHLIA is a film that's difficult to take seriously. It's another subdued, soulless effort from Brian de Palma, the director who could once do no wrong between the 1970s and the early 1990s but who now, like John Carpenter, appears to have lost the talent he once had. This is an overlong film noir, a hardboiled crime yarn featuring a pair of boxers-turned-detectives investigating the Black Dahlia murder in '40s-era Los Angeles. You can sense from the outset that de Palm's heart isn't really in it and who can blame him? He's saddled with a pair of distinctively unimpressive actors as his leads. Aaron Eckhart can be great when he wants to be (think THE DARK KNIGHT) but he can do little with the square-jawed, one-dimensional hero type he plays here. Josh Hartnett (SIN CITY) has the deeper role but didn't appear anything other than bland to this viewer. While it's nice to see Hilary Swank playing against type for once, the female lead is played by the unfortunate Scarlett Johansson, one of those actresses I feel is seriously overrated.

The Black Dahlia,16 September 2006,cultfilmfan,8," The Black Dahlia
","The Black Dahlia is based on the novel of the same name by James Ellroy. It takes place in the 1940's where two former boxers named Bucky and Lee become cops and are eventually assigned to a case involving a brutal murder of an aspiring actress named Elizabeth Short. The film shows the friendship between the two cops and how the case affects them (especially Lee) and how Bucky takes a shine to Lee's girl named Kay and how he also becomes involved with a suspect named Madeleine. The Black Dahlia has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by most of the cast, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration and good costume design. In the 1940's there was a real murder case involving a young woman named Elizabeth Short who was found dead and mutilated and to this day her killer has never been found. Before seeing this film I thought it would be an actual account of the real life murder and investigation, but as the film went by I found out that this is just a fictionalized account of what author James Ellroy pictures happened back then and not what really happened. So, in other words this is not a based on a true story film and it is instead based on a book. That being said there were a lot of things I liked about this movie, but the film also had a lot of flaws as well. One complaint is that there are so many things going on in this movie it takes away from the Black Dahlia case which we assume the film will be about, but in reality it is only a side story in this film with other characters and story lines being focused on more. I thought a lot of the things going on in this film could have been left out and I would have just been glad if they had stuck with the Black Dahlia case. After awhile with all the different characters and things going on the film does tend to get a little confusing. I also found that some of this movie was really campy. Keep in mind I love offbeat films and I don't mind when certain films get campy, but when you take a serious movie like this and throw in camp it just doesn't suit the story and makes certain scenes feel really out of place. Two examples I can think of right off the top of my head are a passionate love making scene between the Bucky and Kay character on a kitchen table and Fiona Shaw who plays Madeleine's mother gives a truly embarrassing performance as the drunken mother. It was more laughable than serious and it almost makes you wonder if she was intoxicated while filming this. Personally, I would have also liked if this film stuck to a real story and followed the actual accounts of the Elizabeth Short murder, but perhaps seeing as it is unsolved there might not have been enough material to make a movie out of the real story. I'm not a screenwriter, so don't ask me. Reviewing the film as it stands though, I' am still giving it a very positive review because it was a very entertaining and compelling film and besides Fiona Shaw the acting is great, the film has style and looks great as well. Despite the silliness and the uneven parts of the film there is still an entertaining time to be had here and most of the time I was really enjoying this film, but had they fixed the few flaws I had with this it could have been a perfect movie instead of just a pretty good one. Still, I liked this movie a lot and if you don't care that this is just a fictionalized account of the story and there are some campy scenes then I suggest you see this movie for pure entertainment and as for style and atmosphere nobody does it better than director Brian De Palma.",/review/rw1476495/?ref_=tt_urv

","Spy Game is everything we're not supposed to expect from a major Hollywood movie: engrossing, intelligent, well written, acted and directed.  But that's just what it is and more, this is definitely the best thing I've seen since Memento.  Although Pitt is really good and Redford plays himself as well as he has in years, I think the most credit should go to Tony Scott. In the hands of a lesser director this could have been something more like Mission Impossible.  But Scott stays right on target, keeping us interested, developing the characters, and keeping the pacing nearly perfect.  Scott also shows us that he's stayed with the times: he employs the full array of modern camera tricks like fast motion, reverse zooms and funky lenses but in a way that actually makes the film better instead of being an annoying distraction.  The dialogue feels natural, all the actors do good work, no one tries to steal the show or be the star.  The story is interesting and almost never lapses into the kind of hyper violence or sappy sentimentality one has come to associate with modern studio pictures.  You get a feeling this is pretty close to how the CIA really operates, a place with fantastic technology at its disposal but who's ultimate effectiveness is determined by the fallible people who run the missions and take the chances.

Spy Game,3 April 2008,FlorianSchirner,9," Intelligent thriller, worthy of Le Carré
","This is what an intelligent and entertaining Spy movie should look like. And I don't mean the ""Super-Spy"" genre with its gadgets and sly wit. In contrary. This is a very clever plot using many time and space spanning scenes. In short it revolves around a young CIA agent (Pitt) who tries to rescue his one time asset and then beloved (McCormack) from a Chinese prison. He gets captured and will be executed a few days later. 24 hours before the execution the CIA learns from his capture and, a presidential visit and trade talks ahead, decide to burn the rogue agent. They contact his recruiter and mentor (Redford) to fill them in on the young agent. This he does. Between these flashback scenes the senior agent uses all his wile he gained as a field agent to set his protegé free. The plot twists several times in unexpected ways and the tricks Redford uses in his scheme are simply great. The fine scene from ""Clear and present danger"", where Ford tries to outsmart his fellow deputy director are but a mere faded memory from this scheming. The directing utilizes modern fast paced cutting and editing, but mostly in scenes where there is action. Unlike many other movies using these methods, here it enhances the film instead ruining it (I regret watching the otherwise great movie ""Man under Fire""). Speaking of action, if you expect an action packed spy movie like the fore-mentioned ""Clear and present danger"", you'll be disappointed. The only shooting involves a bunch of soldiers (first Vietcong, later on US Marines) and is only mere background. Most of the suspense is created verbally and the movie is filled to the brim with adrenaline rising suspense. The acting is very strong, especially Redford and Pitt, which seem to have developed a great chemistry. Having worked together before may have helped. But Redford definitely dominates the movie. His scenes are more than intense and when he unpacks his most dangerous weapon, his smile (in the scene when the nasty superior thinks he has nailed Redford) it is most memorable. I think this is one of his strongest acting.

When I was watching this film I got the impression that the CIA, undoubtedly the preeminent espionage organization on the planet, was being glorified for its interference in foreign conflicts. I couldn't help but remember Benjamin Franklin advising his fellow Republicans to stay out of conflicts that do not threaten America's vital interests.

More than anything else 10'000 BC is a stunning, jaw dropping spectacle from the hunting of the Mammoths to the incredible pyramid building and battles. If there was ONE thing wrong with this film it was it's rating. I am all for a family film, and I'm not some nasty dude who wants blood, guts and gore in everything I see but this film needed adult content. You needed to see the battle, the ruggedness of their lives and the violence, much like Apocalypto but I do understand wanting to keep options open to make more money. I do believe that 10'000 BC was made not as a historical grand epic that would take home awards but to make money period and it will do that I believe.

","To anyone who has ever yearned to see woolly mammoths in full stampede across the Alps, 10,000 BC can be heartily recommended. There's also a flock of ""terror birds""--lethal ostriches on steroids--in a steaming jungle only a splice away from the heroes' snow-dusted alpine habitat. And lo, somewhere in the vastness of the North African desert lies a city whose slave inhabitants alternately teem like the crowds in Quo Vadis during the burning of Rome and trudge in hieratic ally menacing formations like the workers in Metropolis. That's pretty much it for the cool stuff. Setting movies in prehistoric times is dicey. Apart from the ""Dawn of Man"" sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey, only Quest for Fire makes the grade, and its creators had the good sense to limit the duologue to grunts and moans. 10,000 BC boasts a quasi-biblical narrator (Omar Sharif) and characters who speak in formed, albeit uninteresting, sentences--including a New Agey ""I understand your pain."" But let no one say the storytelling isn't primitive. The narrator speaks of ""the legend of the child with the blue eyes"" and bingo, here's the kid now. When, grown up to be Camilla Belle, she's carried off by ""four-legged demons""--guys on horseback to you--the neighbor boy (Steven Strait) who hankers to make myth with her leads a rescue mission into the great unknown world beyond their mountaintop. His name is D'Leh, which is Held, the German for ""knight,"" spelled backward. So yes, there is some hidden meaning after all. 10,000 BC is the latest triumph of the ersatz from writer-director Roland Emmerich. Like Stargate (1994), Independence Day (1996), and The Day After Tomorrow (2004) before it, it's shamelessly cobbled together out of every movie Emmerich can remember to pilfer from (though to be fair, the section in per-ancient Egypt harks back to his own Stargate). Emmerich's saving grace is that his films' cheesiness is so flagrant, his narratives so geared for instant gratification, he can seem like a kid simultaneously improvising and acting out a story in his backyard: ""P'tend there's this alien ... p'tend maybe he came from Atlantis or something....""

The Film ""10,000 B.C."" is to say the least, wildly entertaining. For the child within us, there are plenty of special effects which cause the hair to stand on edge.

True, there aren't notable Hollywood actors or actresses, (Except perhaps Omar Shariff) but those who were depicted, do a superb job. For the factual historian or film realist watching this film, we begin our criticism early, but are soon inundated with such spectacular and visual images, such as man-eating birds, pyramid-building woolly mammoth's, sympathetic Saber-tooth cats and celestial predictions, that we end up enjoying the Atlantian based tale.

This is the first film I've seen with the both of them in it and I can tell why they were paired together here. The chemistry between Matthau and Lemmon is really noticeable throughout this film - they really love working with each other. Everyone else's performances were also very well done. The movie was also pretty funny overall, but what surprised me the most was that this film featured some very touching and heartwarming scenes within it. Honestly, I can say that this movie surprised me all together. I thought I was only going to get a 90 minute film of two old men swearing at each other.

","The opening credits in this film roll to the tune of ""Heat Wave"", and it was during a recent heat wave that I dusted off my well-worn copy of ""Grumpy Old Men"" and settled in to once again watch the first of four movies that made up the ""second coming"" of the Jack Lemmon/Walter Matthau team.  To those who have not yet seen the movie, (yes, there may be a few) it was set (and filmed) in snowy Minnesota, which give the film an authentic small town feel that the talented set designers of Hollywood would be hard pressed to duplicate.  From the stars' first lines in the film (""'Morning ****head"", ""Hello moron"") we know what to expect, and the movie doesn't disappoint us. The verbal sparring between Max and John continues non-stop through 100+ laugh filled minutes.  Both the plot and the ending are not quite believable, but who really cares? For those who want reality, there are many depressing films out there, not to mention the news- papers and CNN. I have never read if all the cast members were the first choices for the parts, but every one of the cast fits their roles perfectly.  Ann-Margret has evolved from her dancing, grinding ""sexpot"" image in the 60's to a wonderful, natural actress. Burgess Meredith....what can I say?  He's perfect as John's father, a crusty, lovable old man.  The interplay between Jack and Burgess is so easy, and why not?  Who better to play a 94 year old than the 80+ year old Meredith. While Burgess is lovable, Daryl Hannah is lovely. As John's daughter Melanie, I have never seen her look more beautiful and heart-melting as she does in this picture.  Ozzie Davis, Kevin Pollak, and Buck Henry round out the cast, and bring their many talents to the picture. While much has been written about the comedy, very little is said about the realistic side of  ""Grumpy Old Men"".  There are a few fleeting scenes that reveal the heartache and loneliness of growing old.  And John's dealings with the I.R.S. in the movie, while hilarious, points out what can happen when the machine-like IRS process starts to roll over an individual not caring about the human-real life side of the situation. The only ""downer"" for me in again watching this movie is the knowlege that the string is over.  Walter and Jack and Burgess are gone.  I can't watch this movie without feeling just a tinge of sorrow.  When most actors their age pass on, we feel sorrow, and then watch their classics from decades ago.  With Walter and Jack the best was yet to come. I have read elsewhere that scripts were in the works for ""Grumpy Old Men 3""  and ""Odd Couple 3"".  Who knows how many more successful films this brilliant team could have made together.  I doubt if the formula for their success would have grown stale, because both Walter and Jack no longer acted....their roles where just an extension of themselves.",/review/rw7144424/?ref_=tt_urv

A grreat and memorable role of the two, and and very hilarious, you'll want to see it again. They are a bunch of bumbling and feuding neighbors, who are in love with the same woman. Every scene with them in this one is unforgettable and outrageously funny. Especially the scenes with Matthau, with the fishing pole that sinks into the ice, he screams loud. An unforgettable scream and very funny too. He does the same when Ann Margaret drops the big fish before he can get a shot of it, and again when he discovers the dried fish that Jack Lemmon put in his car without him noticing it, and I like his line there, ""ya shmuck!"" That was funny. Boy those two are really funny, but at the same time they know how to make dramatic scenes that are almost teary, and sometimes serious and heart-warming ones, but they still become funny at the end and seem to keep it like that.

","In a chilly Minnesota ice-fishing town, two lifelong enemies (who live next door to each other) compete for Ariel, the free-spirited new redhead on the block (Ann-Margret, doing her best with an underwritten role). Comic vehicle for Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon isn't strenuous, it breezes right along, but this type of farce, an insult-slinging sitcom, has been patented and packaged along a cinema assembly-line reaching back many years. The plot is constructed (and constricted) by its one-liners, like a foul-mouthed Neil Simon; the grouchy leads play up the old coot business for all it's worth, but they are so cantankerous that it isn't too likely life-loving Ariel would want either of these guys (her rapport with shopkeeper Ossie Davis, though seen at a distance, appears to be much warmer).

When the show first began in 1989, the Bart-friendly T-shirts and pins seemed borne out of uncertainty over the show's staying power; these days, with the show's position in the TV canon firmly established, your Xbox games are designed for little more than feeding the ""Simpsons"" cash cow. That being said, I revisit the show every once in a while (via taped weekday-afternoon reruns of earlier seasons), and very much appreciate it--the sense of satire is sly, incendiary, and often very funny.

","I'm an absolute fanatic of The Simpsons and have been watching it since it was on Tracey Ullman. I grew up with it. I was the exact same age as Bart when the very first episode premiered. Unlike a lot of fans, I've never turned my back on the show. I am not one who thinks each new episode is worse than the last. I do acknowledge that it's long past its peak, but I think almost every new episode is funny enough to be worth seeing. Once in a while, they'll produce an episode that's genuinely fantastic. But, really, I don't demand fantastic. I'll settle for a few good laughs and be at least moderately happy. Now comes The Simpsons Movie, which had been talked about for the last 15 years, at least. Much like when I watch new episodes, I wasn't expecting the movie to be that great. Unfortunately, it fell below even those expectations. It has a few good jokes and moments (the only time I laughed really loud was the Tom Hanks bit), but it doesn't do much right. Those who've long turned their backs on the show like to complain about recycled plot lines. It's true, of course, for pretty much every new episode, but the show has grown more manic and self-referential over time. Many don't like that, either, but I personally do like those kind of jokes. The movie just plods along with a predictable plot that's made up of some of the most basic of all Simpsons plots: Homer and Marge relationship problems, Lisa's environmental concerns, and Bart's loss of faith in his father. None of it here is done with the irony of the newer episodes. It's like it's part of the really early Simpsons, when we hadn't seen these plots a billion times. Except it completely lacks the perfect comic timing of the early seasons. In the end, the movie is only an occasionally amusing affair.

Maybe I didn't find it as funny and creative anymore. Anyway, The Simpsons Movie is a constantly hilarious and witty movie, that completely exceeded my expectations. Yep, it is very silly, but it is lots of fun as well. So much so, I have decided to give the show another chance. The animation is true to the style of that of the show, with crisp colourful backgrounds and excellent character animation. The music by Hans Zimmer is wonderful, while the master has done better work, the music is still pretty darn good. The theme tune is still as irresistibly catchy as it was when the show first started. The story is a good one, there are tons of hilarious moments and one or two heart-warming ones too. Grandpa's revelation in the church at the beginning was hilarious, and I liked it when Lisa finds a special boyfriend in the name of Colin. I did worry that the environmentalist message would be too heavy handed, but it was handled just right. The voice cast do an exceptional job bringing the iconic characters to life, especially Dan Castallenetta as Homer. And they were aided by some delicious dialogue.

","Matt Groening and company are unmitigated geniuses I tell you. If their plan all along was to make the regular Simpsons TV show and make it progressively more and more awful, such as the case of the series for the last 7 years, and get it to the point of sub-par barely watchable shell of the glory that it once was. And if they did all that JUST to come out with this movie that while never NEVER reaching the classic status of Simpsons yesteryear, yet still much better then the series proper is only to have it viewed as some kind of Oscar-worthy film. Well all I can say is very well played indeed sirs. For those of us that remember how good the series truly was, this bit of fluff involving Homer dooming the the town of Springfield due to his shenanigans, this film was not really made for us and will feel rather repetitive (IE: Homer and Marge fighting AGAIN, Lisa finding a crush AGAIN, even a few jokes are repeated from the series) but rather the newer fans who started watching it at the start of this millennium (yes i know, I shudder at that thought as well) The fact that this film is currently in the top 100 when it has no business in even IMDb's top 250 is both sad and supremely mind-boggling. But again if one is fed a steady diet of feces and then given a moldy stale pork rind, it'd likely taste like top cuisine.",/review/rw1703926/?ref_=tt_urv

I have read all the reviews here, both good and bad, and I can understand where everyone is coming from. Not every show is perfect and I must admit that there were some frustrating parts of the show and a few inconsistencies but I still give it a 10/10 because it did what all good well written and well acted shows should do - it made me feel!

The direction is just wonderful, and the story line so gripping that you keep eagerly waiting for the next episode. I have never loved an actor as much as I love Can Yaman in this show (he's so hot here!), nor a character as much as his here.

","Part. 1
I wasn't familiar with Turkish dramas and comedies, but I stumbled on this series and was hooked from the start. It's heartwarming and joyful, but it is also very emotional, heartbreaking and full of dramatic moments between the main couple. It's one of the best romantic comedies I have seen. The chemistry between the main couple is outstanding. It's full of funny and wonderful characters with their own individual personalities. I like the oddities of the little neighborhood/street corner and its residents and the hectic, creative surroundings of the advertising world. This show knows how to create a moving love story full of tension. It delivers many amazing romantic moments and takes advantage of the actors' charisma & chemistry. The scenery is striking and the music amazing. It's a very enjoyable, feel good, show.

Part 2.
I had to edit my original review. It suffers a lot in later episodes, as story lines become repetitive and some of the romantic scenes seem actually forced. I started to feel they were written as fan service and not as thoughtful and meaningful parts of the story like before. Also the characters seem to make the same mistakes repeatedly, which starts to frustrate. It diminishes the progress that supposedly happened between them in previous episodes. I felt the male lead was reduced to just worship the female lead blindly. And it honestly was a disappointment, because the male lead was such a charismatic, driving force of a nature & deep, thoughtful character. It's like they suddenly decided to prop up the female lead over everyone else, whereas before it was more balanced. The magic of the story suffered a lot from it and the female lead started to seem annoying, jealous & snappish caricature of herself, while the male lead just keeps worshiping her no matter what. The show even had a break and they had enough time to rethink and fix things, but it turned out even worse. It's basically a different show now, and the characters are just annoying. Especially the female lead. They somehow managed to destroy the whole series and the magical and joyful fairy tail feeling it had.",/review/rw7113179/?ref_=tt_urv

","Lucy Kelson {Sandra Bullock} lands a job as chief counsel for a big hitting New York real estate firm that is owned by mega-rich George Wade {Hugh Grant}. He's an engaging enough boss but he's very shallow, and Lucy finds that she's practically running his life for him. So finally tiring of being treated like a Personal Assistant, she gives her two weeks notice of resignation. But can the pair do with out each other? And is there more than a working relationship bubbling under the surface? For his first feature film directing assignment, Marc Lawrence played it safe and got lucky with his lead actors. Whilst hardly setting a new benchmark in the ROM-COM genre, Two Weeks Notice is however witty and not without charm. This is due in the main to the pairing of Grant & Bullock, who play it perky and spark a chemistry so sadly lacking in many other modern day films of its ilk. By their own admission the pair got on great off screen, and that is evident as the pair feed of each other to make the lightweight script work wonders. The dominance of the pair tho leaves little room for the supporting actors to breathe, with many of them coming across as mere fillers.

Bullock does fine, and the character actors support the main players well, particularly the overweight not-pregnant-but-then-is colleague of Bullock's, who gets the best squirming out of Grant. But the whole film lives or dies on the casting of Grant, it is impossible to think of these lines working said by any other actor.

Two Weeks Notice,4 March 2020,festelardon,10," A very, very enjoyable, hilarious rom-com with sparkling lead chemistry
","To all the people complaining out there about this movie, either you have no idea what a rom-com comprises of, or what good acting is all about. Good acting is NOT LIMITED TO PLAYING real people in biographies, or people who are diseased, addicts, orphans, extremely poverty-stricken, with physical/mental disorders, differently-abled people or people in horrifying situations like the War. These sort of roles sure give the actor an advantage- as they can have a shtick to tickle the emotional and moral corners of the audience and award-givers. And in the billion-dollar fantasy franchises, 'action' and special effects dominate, and people's familiarity to these characters is exploited as a guarantee of audience. But what is most difficult to play is playing everyday, normal people, set in the current world, having no such excruciating difficulties or stunning visual effects as props, and yet make them interesting, funny and likeable.
A rom-com is actually the most difficult genre to write and act in, because it totally depends on the skills of the people presenting it, not the 'content'. I mean, people would watch biographies of people they love even if the movie is a dud just because they love the person, and also movies about wars and such horrors of the past as they feel ""they should see it"" as a relic of their history. No such compunctions for a rom-com. On the other hand, in a rom-com, content-wise, the basic story arc is predictable in all romantic films - either a happy or a sad ending, and how they get there, so it's up to the crew and cast to know how to present it. So simply - if it's enjoyable, people see it, if not, they don't.
If you want strange twists in movies, don't go for such movies. Go for Sci-fi, or Action or the other kinds of drama films I mentioned above.
If you want a steady, warm, enjoyable, happy time with a generous number of laughs, go for this film. But don't expect the hero/heroine to turn into a fish, or grow horns, or become a zombie. This aint the place for that. Get used to it.
Well now, let's see for this movie:
Acting: Hugh Grant & Sandra Bullock : 10/10
Chemistry (The Rom): 10/10
Cinematography: 10/10
Dialogues - 9.5/10
Comedy Element (The Com) - 10/10

Two Weeks Notice,26 October 2003,claudio_carvalho,6," A Silly and Predictable Screenplay Supported by the Chemistry of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant
","Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock) is a leftist lawyer graduated in Havard who usually protests against the powerful.  George Wade (Hugh Grant) is a spoiled millionaire, co-owner of a huge construction company. Lucy meets George trying to preserve a community center in Coney Island, where she lives with her parents. George proposes Lucy to be the attorney of his Company, and he would preserve such a beautiful and important building without demolishing. After a period working together, George becomes completely dependent of Lucy, so she decides to quit her job. The rest of the plot is so silly and predictable that does not worth any comment. This movie only works because of the central pair of stars: Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant are wonderful in their roles and in the end the viewer will not be completely disappointed and the movie will entertain. There are some jokes and some deleted scenes that are very funny. Forgettable, but worth to be watched just because of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. My vote is six.",/review/rw3043262/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hugh Grant stopped doing actual romantic comedies after he did the great film Notting Hill. He still does do Romantic comedies, but they're not so romantic. Like Music & Lyrics. A film that I love... I wrote a review for it and said Not quite romantic, but funny as hell. Because that's what that film is. Two Weeks notice is the same way, but this film isn't as good as Music & Lyrics. It's not too far, but it's not quite as good. There's not much wrong with Two Weeks notice. I don't believe that Sandra Bullock's Lucy Kelson character would go out with Hugh Grant's George Wade character. I'm not quite sure if there is much chemistry between the two of them. I do think the two of them worked well, but it didn't really seem like they were that in love. it seems like i'm bashing Two Weeks notice. But that's far from what i'm doing. I was just naming the mistakes. Two Weeks notice does work for a few reasons. Both Grant and Bullock are good together. Also, the film is pretty funny. Mostly thanks to Hugh Grant's character, the usual, of course. Grant is one of my favorite actors. Bullock is one of my favorite actresses.

Shut In,15 March 2016,zardoz-13,9," A Harrowing Home Invasion Thriller!!!
","Adam Schindler has made an impressive directorial debut with his unusual home invasion thriller ""Intruders"" featuring a largely anonymous cast and a story that unfolds in a single setting. The premise of the T.J. Cimfel & David K. White screenplay is provocative. A twentysomething woman, Anna Rook (Beth Riesgraf of ""Scorcher""), hasn't set foot outside her family home since her father died ten years ago. Anna's father, we come to learn later, was not an exemplary role model. What nobody seems to know is that Anna is afflicted with agoraphobia. Open spaces simply terrify her. These days she spends most of her time attending to her dying brother, Conrad (Timothy T. McKinney of ""Bernie""), who is suffering from the ravages of pancreatic cancer. The only bright light in her universe is an amusing meals-on-meals guy, Dan Cooper (Rory Culkin of ""Signs""), who shows up at her door every day with a song and dance routine. A trio of violent thugs, J.P. Henson (Jack Kesy of ""Empire Gypsy""), sadistic Perry Cuttner (Martin Starr of ""Superbad""), and Vance (Joshua Mikkel of ""Terminator Genisys"") break into her home since they figured that Anna would be at her brother's funeral. Anna's condition is so traumatic that when her brother finally succumbs to the disease, she cannot attend his funeral. These three ruffians acquired their information from none other than happy-go-lucky Dan, and he pays a stiff price later for his treachery when Anna learns about his role in the home invasion. Ironically, the three intruders encounter more than they were prepared for. The surprise is really on them because they have broken into no ordinary house. Anna's house is brimming with secrets. Furthermore, the trauma that Anna has suffered with so long actually enables her to dispatch all three villains. Schindler and his writers keep developing the plot in many imaginative ways, and you find yourself enjoying the piecemeal demise that the burglars are doomed to face, particularly Perry. The most heinous of the three is Perry. After the trio learn that Anna is loose somewhere in the house, Perry takes it upon himself to smash the head of Anna's pet parakeet with a hammer. This mindless killing of a harmless bird is the single most sadistic act in ""Intruders."" Happily, Anna pays Perry back with similar treatment to that which he meted out of the poor bird. Not only do these three have no idea that Anna is agoraphobic, but also that she has an interesting background. Typically, home invasion movies present a suspenseful situation that the damsel-in-distress must get out of if she plans to survive. Indeed, in most horror chillers, the female victims need to evacuate themselves from the house or face mortal consequences. What makes Anna's plight so interesting is that she cannot bring herself to cross the threshold. Schindler does a good job cultivating suspense, and ""Intruders"" never wears out its welcome. Beth Riesgraf turns in a terrific performance as the woman-in-jeopardy, and the three thugs are a roughhewn trio that make you worry about our heroine's chances of survival. The dark secret about Anna's life comes into play about a half-hour into the action, and the tension mounts. Aside from our heroine, her three assailants, the meals-on-wheels guy, only one other character shows up for the action. One of Conrad's friends, Charlotte (Leticia Jimenez of ""Pitch Perfect 2""), shows up at the worse moments. ""Intruders"" will keep you poised on the edge of your seat throughout its brisk 90 minutes.",/review/rw3543777/?ref_=tt_urv

But judging the way I look at the trailers, it ended up having a generic and predictable underdog story with nothing new to offer. The humor is pretty weak. And the characters are an entire mixed bag that are either enjoyable or just plain lazy like Steve. My recommendation would have to go with the WWE fans since this is made by the studio. So maybe they'll get a kick out of it. But to anyone else, there's honestly better brawl films. Including the one that came out earlier this year, Godzilla Vs Kong. That doesn't really have the best writing, but it was nicely executed the way it tells the story of the brawl audiences would get hyped of and could be the best MonsterVerse film so far.

Despite being unnecessary, this remake is still quite enjoyable, however, it doesn't have the subtlety of the original and also Terry O'Quinn was much better as a protagonist then Dylan Walsh. O'Quinn had more charisma and delivered his lines with much more impact. And then there's a few things that drag the film down, like the sexualization of Amber Heard ( numerous shots of the young actress in her bikini and underwear, which I wouldn't mind, had it been done more tastefully instead of being a deliberate attempt to please the male audience), plus the poorly done makeovers of David and the lesbian subplot which made absolute no sense to me and seemed out of place.

","I have to give this movie a favorable review only because it delivered something it didn't promise and that took me by surprise. The Stepfather, as I'm sure you all know, is a remake (reboot?) of the 80's slasher series that set the tone for every darn Lifetime movie starring Valerie Bertinelli or Nancy McKeon. A desperate divorcée falls for a mysterious guy who, despite telegraphing to the audience how evil he secretly is, manages to fool his fiancée and her family into thinking that he's a swell guy....that is, until the body count starts. The plot isn't worth discussing. There's nothing here that we haven't seen before. What IS worth discussing is the director's obvious decision to exploit Amber Heard's lovely figure in one long never ending cheesecake sequence. You could make the argument that the ONLY reason this film was even made in the first place was to launch Amber into the stratosphere of blogworthy sex symbols (not unlike what Michael Bay managed to do with Megan Fox). You'll see Amber in her underwear lounging in bed, Amber in her itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini, gratuitous close-ups of her splendid anatomy, etc. This exploitation becomes so flagrant that it distracts from the story itself, which is probably a good thing. In a way the Stepfather 2009 comes off more like a 70's Drive-In flick; the kind teenagers would flock to in hopes of seeing a little skin. Maybe that was the point after all? I sure hope it was.

Well, my wife and our friends wanted to go to the movies and we'd already seen PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and SAW VI. Also, during one of those other recent trips to the theater I had spent a little time before the show sneaking into THE STEPFATHER for about ten minutes and examining what I now realize was its one best scene, so that made me more willing to take a chance and see the whole thing if everyone else was willing at a later date.",/review/rw2144814/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm pretty sure this movie comes on Lifetime about three times a day. Not that there is anything wrong with re-telling an old story. I loved Christian Bale as Batman. But telling a story again in the same way as I've seen it a million times before? No likey. The biggest problem that I have with this movie is this. If there were no music in the entire movie... it would not have been remotely creepy. The only thing that seems to tip characters off that something may be awry is the ominous music in the background. There was not a single genuinely scary moment.

The Stepfather,6 February 2010,Robert_duder,6," How to turn a slasher flick into a PG, made for TV quality ""light thriller""
","Years ago during a love affair with bad 80's slashers with multiple sequels I watched the original The Stepfather which was gory and disturbing and blood soaked like many 80's horror flicks. So I was excited to see this remake because I for one love remakes for the most part (Amityville Horror was amazing!) I should have thought more about this and known that walking into the film they would PG the movie and make it so pre-teen friendly that The CW could air it between Gossip Girl and 90210 (I like both those shows by the way.) Horror is toned down and reduced almost entirely to shock value and 'hidden kills.' That much disappoints and requires the entire film to rely on the cast and for the most part that doesn't work very well. The movie is not un-redeemable and has its moments but it loses a lot of ground in the horror genre. Instead it tries to borrow pieces from teeny thriller flicks like Disturbia, and better made remakes like Friday the 13th, and even Halloween which was not great but at least it was gory as anything. Ultimately the remake of The Stepfather ends up as a teen thriller more than a horror.",/review/rw2144814/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a reality TV series from Netflix all about a company that auctions sports memorabilia. I don't know why I started to watch this, it is not really the kind of thing that I like any more. I think the problem with this whole show is not connected to the show itself, it's connected to this market. These are really rich people, and they're spending a lot of money on things like Pokémon cards from the 1990s. The show also highlights different auctions of different sports memorabilia, and these are things like game worn jerseys and game worn shoes. These are just pieces of equipment, cloth or a little piece of rubber. The only meaning that's attached to it is what we give it. I don't understand why somebody would want some shoes that a basketball player played in once, or a jersey that they wore in one half of the game. It doesn't make any sense to me. They show an auction for a jersey that was worn by Jackie Robinson for one season, so we know that he wore this jersey during this season, and it's a very old school baseball jersey, thick cotton and there's like some blood of Jackie Robinson's on it, and it was being auctioned, and it could have been sold for 7.5 million. I understand why that particular piece of sports memorabilia is so expensive because it has a lot of history, it wasn't just worn one time and Jackie Robinson, of course, is a very historical figure in baseball. All of that makes sense but some random player? I think that's my problem with this whole industry, the false memorabilia creation versus what is actually memorable.

","Oscar season is fully underway as there's nearly a new film every week that is attempting to garner enough praise to warrant awards consideration. Harriet's marketing campaign was less than stellar, and without a lot of buzz, I figured it was going to be a throwaway period piece about an iconic American hero. Luckily, Cynthia Ervo and a great ensemble help put this fill over the mediocre edge and instead boast a crowd-pleaser of a film. One that audiences seem to be on board with, and rightfully so.

","Harriet is not just a standard biopic on an extraordinary life, but an embrace of pain and glory and all that comes with it. Harriet shines best with portraying emotion and capturing that through its audacious style of directing, cinematography, and some great performances throughout. The film's script may seem to make the whole deal a bit choppy at times, but the film knows how to handle itself properly and thus doesn't linger to be an issue in the long run. Cynthia Erivo gives one of her best performances to date as the title star, truly capturing every bit of detail and emotion needed to play the true life figure. The use of music and sound throughout the film makes for a thrilling and somber piece of work, all needed to truly tie the film together. Harriet may also struggle a bit to find its footing towards the end, but as it wraps, you can't help but marvel at what a piece of work the film is, let alone Harriet herself.

Harriet,1 February 2020,CubsandCulture,8," The script is too bare bones and saccharine but a good biopic nonetheless.
",The film is ultimately fairly frustrating. The central performance by Erivo was really good and powerful. The film is quite handsome-it was nice seeing some photography by Toll with a budget. The technical aspects provoke period and the director gets a lot of suspense out of Tubman's escape and rescue missions. The film takes a pretty narrow range of Tubman's life as its plot but working within that range it seems to be fairly accurate. It certainly was engaging. The film resists centering whiteness-abet not fully-and I was glad to see that the Underground Railroad seemed to be almost exclusively black. The film doesn't contain a white savoir trope so there's at least that.,/review/rw5264557/?ref_=tt_urv
Harriet,26 November 2019,classicsoncall,8," ""I'm gonna be free or die.""
","A number of the reviews I've read here on IMDb are decidedly negative on ""Harriet"", citing facets of her life that were inaccurately portrayed in the movie. I've seen enough films based on historical figures to know by now that historical accuracy isn't always of the most paramount importance when making a film. Whether the real life Harriet Tubman ever picked up a firearm isn't what's going to make me give the movie a thumbs down or not. Not knowing much about her history other than the dedication she showed in freeing as many fellow slaves as she could, I thought the picture did an admirable job of telling her story. Cynthia Erivo appears to have been an excellent choice to portray Araminta Ross Tubman, resolute in her quest to obtain personal freedom at the expense of her own life were she ever to be apprehended by Southern slave catchers. The hatred for Blacks and the cruelty slave owners were capable of is demonstrated by her former 'owners', notably Gideon Brodess (Joe Alwyn) and his mother Eliza (Jennifer Nettles). More so via dialog than by actual physical punishment; we are not witness to some of the horrors that were exposed in ""12 Years a Slave"", 2014's Best Picture Winner at the Oscars. An overall fine cast and compelling story makes this one of the year's best offerings, and certainly a contender for it's share of awards in due course.",/review/rw5264557/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've been wanting something new to watch and decided to give this show a try. The location, what we see of it is nice but the characters are just, too over the top. As other reviewers stated it's not really a drama or a comedy and certainly not much of a mystery. The tired plot line of a husband with a secret life gets hold and hard to believe. I will continue to watch to see if it gets better but I have my doubts. It makes a good multi task show as in folding laundry or ironing.

White Gold,26 May 2017,peterrichboy,8," Very funny piece of eighties nostalgia
","You know your getting old when they start making shows from an era you grew up in. As you watch it you start to point out the cars, clothes, music and haircuts the 80's really were the time that fashion forgot. The makers of the show have nailed that period in time superbly, and the script by Inbetweeners creator Damon Beesley is equally good. Anyone who lived through that period would have come across the lead character Vince Swan played by the impressive Ed Weswick. In the case of White Gold we have double glazing salesman all pushing for that big end of month bonus. But it could just as easily been Estate Agents Car Salesmen the 80s were all about excess and earning as much money as you could and that's really the premise of the show in a nutshell. There are natural comparisons to the Inbetweeners as Joe Thomas and James Buckley play pretty much play the same characters Jay and Simon in this show, nothing wrong with that the Inbetweeners was one the funniest sitcoms of recent years. And whilst White Gold may not reach those dizzy heights it's not far behind.",/review/rw3799969/?ref_=tt_urv

It made even the best telly drama and comedy look insipid – think of Only Fools and Horses with realism, Men Behaving Badly with pathos, Sherlock with engaging vulgarity and Bluestone 42 you couldn't add to that because it was similarly uncompromising. All the cast were terrific but it was Ed Westwick's take on Vincent, the leading character, which did the heavy-lifting. The usual compliments for a good performance aren't sufficient – 'electrifying and totally committed' get nowhere near - all art is artifice so how about, 'So real you could smell the b.o. breaking through the cheap deodorant. I loved the way he did asides to the audience and, once again (like Alfie, Flashman, Richard lll) was seduced by an appalling character's honesty in his villainy.

The Jude Law-ish cool cat who narrates and gives constant monologues to the the camera/viewer. His off-the-charts narrating drives the comedy into the sublime depraved idiot level. How these people dress themselves is a small wonder. They're clueless save for a penchant for keeping on day after day - somehow achieving more bad behavior.

White Gold,26 August 2017,bpilgrim-46229,8," Loved it !
","This TV series, which just premiered on Netflix, is basically a chance to see Ed Westwick play the part of Chuck Bass again. If you loved the arrogant asshole that Chuck Bass was in Gossip Girl, you'll definitely love Vincent Swan. The cast in this show is absolutely great. Ed Westwick, James Buckley and Joe Thomas are an incredibly funny trio that you will for sure grow fond of over the episodes. If you've ever worked or been in contact with sales, you'll definitely relate to the characters and the situations that they find themselves in. It is a great example of a smart comedy. What I think makes the series so funny and interesting is the fact that the main character, Vincent, talks a lot to the audience, becoming also some sort of narrator. The soundtrack is also great, featuring a lot of amazing songs from the 70's and 80's , such as Another One Bites the Dust, by Queen. However, something that I've wondered is : How will the writers continue the series without making it boring, since, well, a salesman's life can be interesting only to an extent. There's one thing that,to me, isn't much of a problem, but I can understand why some people have complained about it is that, even if you are a fluent English speaker, but don't understand very well people that speak with a heavy Essex accent, you'll definitely have trouble understanding everything they say, which means you'll have to pay a great deal of attention to what's being said.",/review/rw3799969/?ref_=tt_urv

The attention to historical detail is brilliant, and the soundtrack is awesome if you love the 80s vibe.

","When a small geriatric hospital in Northern England is threatened with closure, the staff and patients rally together to try and save it. There might be a glimmer of hope with this task as the government consultant tasked with the final evaluation - ""Colin"" (Russell Tovey) has his estranged father "" Joe"" (David Bradley) in that self same facility. The place is run under the benignly imperious hand of ""Sister Gilpin"" (Jennifer Saunders) with Bally Gill's ""Dr. Valentine"" tending to their clinical needs. As you'd expect with Alan Bennett, this comes at you from the left of the political spectrum, and highlights what he sees as the short-termism of fiscally based decision making. To that end, Sir Richard Eyre has assembled a strong cast of formidable character actors to portray the patients. Most notable amongst them, for me, was Julia McKenzie and Bradley is also on great form as the curmudgeonly old gent coming to terms with his predicament and his successful, gay, son. There is plenty of dry humour, observational sarcasm to the fore and Saunders and Gill have quite a nice chemistry between them as they both strive to care for their elderly charges. I can't say that I loved the ending. It is thought provoking, but somehow seemed just a little over-dramatic and unnecessary. That said, though, the ensemble cast reminded me very much ""Quartet"" (2012) with strong leading characters and familiar faces at every turn helping to highlight the serious (and lighter) issues of the ageing process for both the older folks and for those charged with keeping them well.

Allelujah,7 April 2023,jboothmillard,4," Allelujah
","I had seen the colourful poster and the trailer for this film a few times before its release, the cast of great British talents was obviously what caught my eye, I had heard mixed things about it, but I still went to see it at the cinema, based on the play by Alan Bennett, directed by Richard Eyre (Iris, Stage Beauty, Notes on a Scandal, The Children Act). Basically, the Bethlehem hospital, nicknamed ""the Beth"" by locals, staff, and residents, is a small geriatric hospital in the city of Wakefield, West Yorkshire. It is threatened with closure due to funding cuts to the NHS. Among the staff working at the hospital is Indian student Dr. Valinder Singh Vashish, known simply and affectionately as Dr. Valentine (Bally Gill), and it is easier to pronounce. Head nurse Sister Alma Gilpin (Jennifer Saunders) is cynical, and world-weary, she is to be honoured for her services to the Beth with a concert and the presentation of a medal. A filming crew from local television programme Pennine People have been invited to the hospital to document their work and the efforts to save it from closure. During the filming, they interview the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Salter (Vincent Franklin), and some of the residents. The residents include poetry-loving grammar-obsessed retired teacher Ambrose (Derek Jacobi), quiet incontinent patient Molly Earnshaw (Eileen Davies) who bangs a tray whenever she needs the toilet, and shy but observant former librarian Mary (Judi Dench) who is reluctant to be on camera but is given a tablet to record day-to-day events in the ward. Meanwhile, Colin Colman (Russell Tovey), a consultant to the Health Secretary who had advised the closure, arrives at the Beth to visit his elderly father Joe (David Bradley), and assess the hospital. In the morning, patient Molly is found dead; she was initially looked after by Valentine but tended to by Alma the following night. The Beth is threatened with legal action by Molly's daughter (Lorraine Ashbourne) and son-in-law (Detectorists' Gerard Horan), who were due to inherit her home only three months later. During this time, work experience student Andy (Louis Ashbourne Serkis, Andy's son) assists staff at the hospital, and Colin reconnects with his estranged father. Realising the Beth's importance to both his father and the local community, Colin returns to London. Although he passionately defends the hospital in a meeting, he storms out his pleas are ignored by his colleagues. That night, Andy cannot prevent Joe from soiling himself in his bed. He is tended to by Alma, who makes a reference to him being on ""the list"". Joe is afraid following this comment and calls Colin to confide in him. The next morning, Andy arrives at the Beth and finds Joe dead in his bed. Alma is due to receive her honour at the ceremony later that day. Before it starts, Mary privately shows Valentine a video she took of Alma tending to Molly. Valentine deduces that Alma has been poisoning the frailest patients of the hospital with morphine mixed into cups of warm milk. The Chairman of the Board is alerted of this during the ceremony. Alma is jailed for life, and the Beth is closed, with its residents being moved to various other facilities. Later, Valentine is shown working in an intensive care unit at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. One day, he encounters Ambrose, who holds his hand in his last moments before he dies. An angry Valentine leaves the hospital and breaks the fourth wall with a heartfelt monologue defending the NHS. Also starring Jessica Baglow as Dr. Jess, Julia McKenzie as Patient, and Marlene Sidaway as Lucille. Saunders is relatively interesting as the no-nonsense head nurse, Gill is alright as the selfless doctor, Bradley makes an impression as the ailing father, Jacobi gets some chuckles with his one-liners, and Dench is underused as the wallflower patient who knows more than you know. The first hour or so of the film is nice and simple, with likeable characters played by an impressive cast, some amusing bits in the script, and a good shout out to the brilliant medical care and work of the NHS. But then it all falls apart with the ""twist"" in the subplot near the end, the unacceptable and weird tonal shift involving the killing of patients by a nurse just doesn't work. If it wasn't for this misjudged and inappropriate mistake, then the film might have been worthwhile, most of it before that is absolutely fine, but I was disappointed; as an overall film, it's a relatively reasonable only just watchable drama.

When you compare a movie from 1973, with decent special effects, with a movie from 2005, or 32 years of advanced technology, then you can only conclude that this isn't good at all.

","Much has been made of the peculiarly Kafka-esquire journey of 'Dominion': originally in the hands of the late John Frankenheimer, the 'Exorcist' prequel project was turned over to Paul Schrader, director/screenwriter best known for dark, gritty, existential dramas such as 'Taxi Driver,' 'Hardcore,' and 'Auto-Focus.' Schrader delivered a film allegedly close in spirit to the original, but the suits were unsatisfied, feeling that the film they'd been given lacked the necessary frights to please the current audience for horror films. As has been amply explained, the original 'Exorcist' was itself much less a horror film than a psychological drama, spare of excessive fun-house shock value, but the audience has changed--younger, dumber, and trained to expect cheap thrills--and the decision was handed down to re-tool the film to add more special effects and gore. Schrader refused, was fired and replaced by Renny Harlin, who re-shot the film almost entirely with a significantly revised story, several new actors and characters, and a decidedly less cerebral approach. But Schrader's film was already in the can, and horror purists and Exorcist junkies were left to wonder what might have been--if, for once, there might be a sequel/prequel that made genuine efforts to add to a story's mythic tradition rather than merely to exploit its notoriety to sell tickets and popcorn.",/review/rw1264879/?ref_=tt_urv

Dominion Prequel to the Exorcist,27 May 2005,stevenw-1,," Solid. Unexpected, effective film.
","Exorcist: The Beginning was an ineffective film that contains everything I hate about current genre films: impatient editing and storytelling, lines of dialogue that stop just when some characters are about to actually say something, bombardment of CGI visuals and some seriously unnecessary gore effects that are akin to the movie-makers hitting the audience over the head with a Warner Brothers iron anvil normally reserved for their cartoon characters. What a nice surprise it was to finally see DOMINION on it's (unfortunate) limited run. Here is a movie that doesn't assume the audience is too stupid to actually sit down and take a story in without excessive music video stimuli. Here is a movie who's build-up is effective and will have many working hard to shake the uneasy feeling that, indeed, evil IS everywhere. There were some story elements from ""The Beginning"" that made no sense whatsoever. In this film - all is presented clearly, thoughtfully and much more unsettling (but it really hits you when the film comes to its climax). There is a scene in ""The Beginning"" where some crazed hyenas savage a character to shreds. Their appearance was curious and not presented as necessarily crucial to the film other than for one scene. In this film, just one look from them and you know right away they add to the whole atmosphere of the film. They are an ever present danger not only to the surrounding location but the always present evil watching humanity just out of sight and ready to attack when one is most vulnerable and alone. Another sequence featuring Father Merrin and Nazi soldiers is given a very clever, diabolic twist and adds MUCH to the notion of how the Devil deceives and tricks. In the other film, it's a scene where you know only that ""this is what torments Father Merrin"" - and that's it. Which is how this movie plays against Renny Harlin's ""The Beginning"" - an easy sell to the masses (it STILL didn't work). ""Dominion"" is a crafted piece where one single shot holds more story information than a 30 second sequence rife with vulgar, over-the-top digital effects.

How many times since Davy Crockett have you seen a flintlock actually fire in a movie?  The lodges were from Panther Primitives and Farley's pistol is an early 1800's Harper's Ferry. 2) The crew members all had distinct personalities. The members of the Corp of Discovery varied from well educated to nearly illiterate though all were accomplished at their respective skills. 3) Anyone who has ever been on a long term encampment will remember humorous events. 4) There were other explorers and adventurers on the Missouri in 1803-1806.  5) The dialog, while humorous, is accurate to the time and circumstances.

I really like Bidwell, his misadventures had me rolling on the floor in laughter, but the comedic genius of Farley had me going too. One of my most favorite parts had to be when they bring the boat ashore and meet the Native Americans, and they think the really tall one's the Chief, but it turns out he's not, his real name's Bent Twig and he's really mentally retarded.

","Loved season 1. But the writing in season 2 has gone downhill fast. Whenever writers run out of ideas they inject politics as plot filler which is exactly what the writers did for season 2. And when feminism is added, logic is removed. Why can two average female characters beat up a handful of gangsters? Per the writers, ""just because (female power or something.. who knows?)"". For example, one line of dialogue about how Clair is not from dramaworld, so she has more control over the physics of dramaworld would have made that more logical. Not to mention, it's not heroic in the least to beat someone up for insulting or disrespecting you. It's childish. Somehow Park Joon is no longer masculine at all. How about Evan? Has the actor who plays him ever worked outside a day in his life? There's not a tough bone in his body. It's hard to relate to a character that seems to have had such an easy life that he could be so soft and feminine. Which reminds me again of the illogical nature of the story - why would a mob boss choose such a weak person to join his family? Answer: they wouldn't. Stories don't have to match the real world but they have to be explainable within the logic of the newly created world.

","Power Rangers SPD, whose initials stand for ""Space Patrol Delta"" actually stand for ""Shabby, Poor and Doltish"" or however negatively they stand for. It may not be the worst Power Rangers installment, but it is one of the most lackluster ever, just like most of its various predecessors, especially when Disney took over its franchise from Saban in 2002 (actually Saban was no better, either). The setup of the cast of characters and the plots or story lines are so screwed up for most of the Power Rangers sequels that just make no sense at all. In otherwords, they poured way too many unintelligent ideas into virtually each episode of so many installments to date due to ill-preparedness of the crew members (i.e., writers, actors, producers, directors, etc.). At least the Japanese version of the TV series, otherwise known as ""Super Sentai,"" which is the original source that has been partially used to produce the Power Rangers TV series, is far better in terms of story lines/plots and cast of characters setup as well as other aspects than the TV series produced by Saban and Disney. I acknowledge that the Power Rangers TV series would go on and on, but I feel Disney production people are simply wasting their time, money and energy in making such show that even some people call it a ""rip-off"" since they ""cut and pasted"" borrowed ideas from the original source to the product of its adaptation, which eventually would make the show less interesting to watch. Instead of hiring actors, many of whom are virtual unknowns and don't know how to act well, they should start doing complete voice-overs of the aforementioned original Japanese TV series with certain edits each and every year, or cancel the show altogether. Even most Power Rangers fans (including many kids) would prefer to watch the Japanese-made Super Sentai TV series over the Power Rangers TV series adapted by Saban and Disney, especially if they find out the truths as to how the Power Rangers TV series is produced. Because the original TV series is more well-elaborated in so many ways than we could ever imagine. And it does not take a genius to figure it out!",/review/rw1320402/?ref_=tt_urv

""Matinee"" is director Joe Dante's ultimate tribute to typically 50's Sci-Fi B-movies and massively promoted gimmick-laden low-budget flicks; particularly the repertoire of the legendary William Castle. In one of his most glorious roles to date, John Goodman depicts the unscrupulous and sleazy horror movie producer Lawrence Woolsey, who is practically the reincarnation of William Castle, what with his sly and shameless salesmanship techniques and continuous wide-mouthed smile. At the highpoint of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Woolsey jaunts out to Key West  where the Navy and population hectically prepares for a bomb attack  in order to proudly present his newest and supposedly most shocking motion picture named ""Mant"". ""Mant"" is a silly shock feature about a man slowly mutating into a gigantic ant after being exposed to nuclear radiation, and for the big premiere Woolsey stuffed the film theater with horrid decorations and gimmicks to raise extra fear in the audience. With the threat of actual bombing attack going on outside the theater, Woolsey bumps into a lot of protest and resistance from the adult population in Key West, but luckily the younger and horror-crazed generation are wildly enthusiast about the upcoming matinée preview. With ""Matinee"", the still incredibly underrated director Joe Dante delivered another delicious and charming movie. The extended bits and clips from the fictional movie ""Mant"" masterfully capture the essence of 1950's B-movie cinema, with grotesque ideas and effects, cheesy nonsensical dialogs and wooden acting performances. The real William Castle actually never made such a type of monster movie, but the gimmicks and promotional stunts (like buzzers underneath the seats and guys in rubber suits running around) are right up his delightful alley! But ""Matinee"" is a terrifically clever movie on other levels as well. Apart from a wonderful homage to horror cinema, it also contains an admirable ""coming of age"" sub plot and it effectively parodies the mass hysteria going on around the time of the Cold War. Whilst the adult population of Key West practices their duck & cover bomb alarms and prepare their shelters, the teenagers are more concerned about finding a date to go see ""Mant"" on Saturday. The acting performances are fantastic (like his monster ""Mant"", John Goodman himself is larger than life!), the decors and atmosphere of the early 60's are marvelously re-enacted and  in good old Joe Dante tradition  there are multiple cameos of horror veterans, like Dick Miller, Kevin McCarthy and Robert Cornthwaite. This is truly a film meant for genuine horror movie buffs, but nevertheless a stupendously enjoyable comedy for all type of audiences.",/review/rw4102961/?ref_=tt_urv
Matinee,6 February 2003,Infofreak,," 'Matinee' is light-hearted fare, sure, but lots of fun for movie buffs who love b-grade 1950s and 1960s monster movies.
","I have a lot of time for Joe Dante. Most of his movies are fairly light-hearted, nostalgic fare aimed at kids or the young at heart, but unlike his occasional collaborator Steven Spielberg he really pulls it off convincingly without getting too sentimental and treacly, and always has enough in-jokes and references in his movies to amuse diehard science fiction and horror film buffs. Dante is a BIG fan of film makers like Roger Corman (who gave him his big break), William Castle (a major inspiration for 'Matinee') and Mario Bava, while one has to wonder if Spielberg even knows who they are. 'Matinee' is a slight, but very entertaining picture, concerning b-grade 50s/60s horror movies, and fans of that era will absolutely love it. John Goodman ('The Big Lebowski') plays flamboyant writer/director Lawrence Woolsey. Woolsey's gimmicks and showmanship are inspired by William Castle ('The Tingler', '13 Ghosts', 'House On Haunted Hill',etc.etc.) though the fictional movie 'Mant' which is part of the plot is quite unlike Castle's output and closer to 50s paranoid monster movies like 'Them!' and 'Tarantula'. Goodman is perfectly cast and loads of fun. I also really liked Cathy Moriarty ('Raging Bull') as Woolsey's leading actress/assistant. The chemistry between the two was enjoyable and made for some nice comic touches. The young kid actors were all pretty good, and Dante regulars Dick Miller ('A Bucket Of Blood'), Kevin McCarthy ('Invasion Of The Body Snatchers'), Robert Picardo ('Star Trek Voyager') and William Schallert ('The Incredible Shrinking Man') seem like they are all having a wonderful time. Trivia buffs note that this movie includes an actor from 'The Thing From Another World' (Robert Cornthwaite) and also one from John Carpenter's remake 'The Thing' (David Clennon'). The movie within the movie 'Mant' is hilarious, but I enjoyed the whole thing. 'Matinee' is another fun movie from the underrated Joe Dante.",/review/rw4102961/?ref_=tt_urv

Matinee,1 September 2002,Tommy-5,," A pleasant stroll down Memory Lane
","`Half Man, Half Ant, All Terror!,' screams the promotional for fictional film producer Lawrence Woolsey's newest film, Mant. Mant is the film within the 1993 film titled Matinee. 	Matinee, starring John Goodman as the William Castle-like Woolsey, is director Joe Dante's valentine to all of us who grew up in the middle of the cold war. That he has managed to combine a salute to the science fiction films of the 1950's and early 60's with a warning about nuclear power and human imperfection is quite impressive. 	The plotline is straightforward. Woolsey and his delightful lover, leading lady and all around Girl Friday Ruth, ably played by Cathy Moriarty, (who shows she could have been a great 50's sci-fi heroine), roll into Key West, Florida for a sneak preview of his latest film, Mant. The weekend of the big event, autumn of 1962, also happens to be the time of the Cuban missile crisis. Here the story gets a little stretched as we try to keep up with all that is going on. Panicky theatre managers, adolescent love and jealousy, and several amusing scenes from Mant are among the many points of interest against the sobering backdrop of the missile crisis, only 90 miles away in Cuba. This film is a bit hard to describe, the best thing to do is rent it and enjoy it for yourself. Much of it takes place in the theatre on Saturday afternoon and is a true trip down memory lane for old guys like me who lived during this era and remember very well what indoor theatres were like in 1962. 	Mant is a special treat for all of us who love the sci-fi films of that era. It has several un-credited science fiction legends in it (Kevin McCarthy, William Schallert and Robert Cornthwaite appeared with the sultry Moriarty) and numerous insider jokes. McCarthy was `General Ankrum.' Oh Brother! Is there a sci-fi fan anywhere who is not aware that the late Morris Ankrum made a career of portraying military generals in these types of films? This is only one example of a ton of fun in this film. 	There were other appearances by old time favorites, such as Jesse White and Roger Corman regular Dick Miller. It is obvious that everyone had a good time making Matinee and just about all of the performances are way over the top, especially Goodman's. He held his oversized stogie just like Castle used to. 	I've heard that there are more Mant scenes in the DVD version of Matinee but I have been unable to locate what has turned out to be a harder to obtain film that I imagined it would or should be. 	Matinee is a warm-hearted gem. By all means make the effort to see this one if you can obtain a copy. I promise, you will not be disappointed.",/review/rw4102961/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had just recently watched Matinee for the first time in a few years. I forgot how much fun and how very funny a film it was. Having grown up watching some of William Castle's and Roger Corman's hokey but very entertaining early horror films it was like a stroll down memory lane on my Saturday's. Goodman captured the essence of a movie showman who always had or wanted to have a gimmick to go with his B movie pictures. Cathy Moriarty is excellent as his favorite leading lady. I must be showing my age because I still remember the duck and cover and other little things associated with everyday life and times during the late 1950's and early 1960's that were in the movie. The movie was entertaining and a very nice parody, if not dedication to the men who made B movies as part of our culture. I have to believe this dedication to men like Corman and Castle would have to be a bit of a tongue in cheek parody for it to be a very sincere dedication. The movie does an excellent job of bring back the life and times and the performances as pretty good. Aaaahhhh the memories. The cold war and much simpler times and classic B movies.

The best part of the movie, however, is the movie within a movie....MANT...the story of a man that is half-man and half-ant.  The scenes of this film alone are good enough reason to see Matinee.  The one scene where the Mant character throws an ant farm to the ground and yells ""You're free, You're free"" is hilarious. The movie characters are also made up of old sci-fi stars Kevin McCarthy(Invasion of the Body Snatchers), William Shallert(Hundreds of films it seems), and Robert Cornwaithe(The Thing).  Also look for John Sayles and Dick Miller in smaller roles hamming it up.  Goodman is larger than life in his portrayal, much the same way that Castle was.

","Not really a horror movie, per se, but a family comedy that revolves around B-horror movies. John Goodman plays a William Castle-like horror filmmaker who is premiering his new movie Mant (half-man, half-ant!) in Key West during the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Goodman has imagined Mant as a very interactive experience, with rumbling seats that can give the audience light shocks, pyrotechnics and a man wearing a Mant suit who wanders into the audience at certain points. The movie mostly revolves around the children who are going to see the movie. The film has a lot of problems. The kid characters are all pretty uninteresting, and the main plot of the film, which is about Simon Fenton, a horror fan, missing his father, who is in the military on a boat outside of Cuba, reeks of grade C Spielberg. And the screenwriters figure that they can't have a movie where people are just sitting around watching another movie, so there are a whole bunch of subplots where the kids wander off during the movie to do other stuff. Ironically, the parts where we're watching Mant are by far the best part of the movie. I've heard so much about how good this was for years, and been wanting to see it forever (it was out of print on DVD for years), so I have to say it's a pretty big disappointment.

And so were the costumes and the sets. In short the art director is a genius. And I finally feel that they got the look of Jerusalem almost right- at least the best version of Jerusalem on screen I've ever seen. (Kingdom of heaven's Jerusalem was awful).

Ben-Hur,26 August 2016,Troy_Campbell,3," Bland and misjudged. Furthers the bad reputation of remakes.
","Remakes, reboots, re-imaginings, revamps – whatever you may call them, they're predominantly regarded as unoriginal and/or unnecessary cash-ins. They're not all a waste of time (think The Departed or Let Me In), but it's vapid movies like this that ensure their bad name stays in tact. Lets start with the positives though. With Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Day Watch, Wanted) behind the camera stylish action sequences are all but guaranteed, and an incredible battle at sea witnessed from below the decks undeniably delivers on this front. He's also lucky his two leading men, Jack Huston as the eponymous persecuted Jew and Toby Kebbell as his vengeful Roman (adopted) brother, are both extremely strong actors who manage to turn even the worst dialogue into semi-watchable melodrama. That's where the praise stops unfortunately, for the rest of the film shouts disaster. The most notable flaw is the casting of Morgan ""paycheque"" Freeman, who plummets to new depths of awfulness thanks to his phoned-in performance, a lazy and clichéd narration, and a wig that'll enter the hairpiece hall of shame alongside Travolta's hairdo from Battlefield Earth. There are also a plethora of bizarre choices made by the filmmakers, including an embarrassingly out-of-place epilogue featuring Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro) that should've been either fleshed out more throughout the runtime or cut away entirely. As is increasingly common in modern blockbusters there's also a heavy use of CGI – which in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing – except here it is woefully underdone and sticks out like a sore thumb, especially in the numerous wide shots attempting to establish scale and grandeur. Perhaps most disappointing is the underwhelming chariot-race finale that, for all its hand-held camera-work and gritty intentions, is stunted by messy editing, weirdly absent violence and poor choreography that fails to hide the dumb conveniences within the race. Capped off with an atrocious song played over the final moments, Ben-Hur 2.0 is a bland and misjudged rehash of a swords-and-sandals classic.",/review/rw3634094/?ref_=tt_urv

","The classic 1959 Charlton Heston version is the one I and the rest of the baby boomers grew up on and it remains one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. But I was very impressed by the 2016 remake. Gone is the stilted dialogue and ""holy look"" (as Victor Mature described it) of the old time biblical epics. The 2016 version has a bold take on the classic and a fresh approach to the story. It surpasses the 1959 version in originality, imagination, and devotion to detail. The Roman legion is shown in all its scope, strength, and ruthless brutality. The character of Jesus has a prominent role, whereas in the classic version, he never spoke nor did we see his face. With anti Christian sentiment on the rise in the entertainment industry, I wonder if the negative reviews written about this film reflect the agenda driven bias of the critics. The sea battle was spectacular and far surpassed the 1959 version. The epic chariot race was a wonderful homage to the Heston version, complete with the awe inspiring stadium built into living rock and with giant statues in the middle of the track. The race itself rivals the classic one in intensity and imagination. Terrific movie, great acting, and intense realism. The acting, however was not nearly as good as the 1959 version. I would say that the actor who played Ben Hur was grossly miscast. . Also, Ben Hur's sister was seen wearing pants.. loose fitting, but definitely pants. The chariot race had wonderful moments, but went overboard with the CGI at the end. The 1959 version was superior, but this one was pretty good.",/review/rw3634094/?ref_=tt_urv

","Admittedly, re-telling the story of Ben-Hur in modern cinema seems remarkably unnecessary since the original film was already so good in it's own merit. But to say that this is a bad movie would be a lie. There are plenty of powerful moments that portray betrayal and survival with its dialogue staying engaging and competent. Convincing acting from Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell helps establish a heartfelt brotherhood of joy and sadness that shines in key moments in all three acts. Even the supporting cast does a solid job establishing the tention of the conflict at hand. A serviceable soundtrack and action set pieces build to a good climax as well. I do agree with most that Timur Bekmambetov's frequent ""free style"" camera control is distracting with the consistent shaking and close-up shots rob what could have been sweeping epic shots to fuel the emotions of the film better. And the way some dialogue is delivered falls flat when the passage of time or awkward pacing steals their thunder. And of course, it's worth confirming that the CGI scenes are...pretty bad at times. In the end, why fix what isn't broken? It's tough to live up to an already fantastic film, and this 2016 adaptation of Ben-Hur will likely drown in history as another ""Hollywood cash-grab"".

","Paramount Pictures and MGM Studios present the reimagined classic historical drama of Ben-Hur. Appropriately released by two of the most recognized names in the industry hearkening back to the early days of cinema, Ben-Hur plays out almost as well as it did decades ago. Sitting in the auditorium last night, I wondered what it was like to see a larger-than-life nail-biting story on the silver screen when the original was released in 1959, just before the final decline of the former powerhouse of motion picture production, the studio system. The grand experience of this film is only overshadowed by the unusual pacing. Typically epic stories require a minimum of two hours, and typically come close to 3-hour runtimes in order to do the story justice and tell is visually and emotionally in the most impactful way possible; however, this film is just over two hours. This moderately quick pacing hinders one's ability to really appreciate the foreground and background stories. The grandeur of the Roman Empire fails to show as prominently as it should have in this film that bares a striking resemblance to Ridley Scott's Gladiator in many respects. Still, there are many sweeping shots of the Circus (chariot racing arena) that is disappointingly mostly CGI'd. Still, there is something remarkable about this story. Whether you are approaching this film from a historic standpoint (historic in an appreciation for classic Hollywood stories), religious perspective (forgiveness and sacrifice), or simply for the bad ass racing of chariots in a grand arena, you will likely find something to enjoy about this movie.",/review/rw3634094/?ref_=tt_urv

There were graphic parts in the movie, such as the Romans marching loudly through the streets of Jerusalem, the chariot race, and then Jesus hanging on the cross while his blood was running down from him.

","It isn't the epistolary novel put to digital media - that wouldn't be possible would it, as it would still require a screenwriter/adaption - so complaints that it isn't that are a bit weird - also part of the joy of the epistolary form is that the authors aren't an objective narrator so as you read you fill in the gaps, guess at the truth, compare and contrast. That is what this take does, it is an expanded universe imagined from those letters and using more modern critiques of the excesses and hypocrisy of the historical period. Its fun, fruity and with enough faithfulness to the time (with the added glamour and gorgeousness and grime and stench in other settings, that you want from entertainment) to give new insights and considerations into this time in France. The acting is largely good, the script and dialogue trot along nicely and are funny and intriguing without being too earnest or 'olde worlde' clunky, and the cast, costumes and sets are presented brilliantly, producing a well realised world. Ongoing and boring complaints from reviewers who are obsessed with how much melanin some actors have proves again that they need to read more books (I mean Jean-Baptiste Belley was elected to the French Parliament 10yrs after the first book so the idea that people of colour weren't in respected/high positions at this time is pure nonsense)

","Not based on any book or movie. I only watched this due to my obsession with costume drama and 18th century in particular. But there is a reason I prefer to rewatch BBC series from the seventies to most of the newer films and series claiming to be ""period drama"". Those at least followed the basic mores and customs of the time portrayed for the most part and worked hard to get the shapes of costumes and hair accurate. Now in these newer ones you see long flying curls on grown women (which you would not see even on little girls in most eras) modern eye makeup and ""shrugs"" to act as Spencer jackets etc...to name just a few. I love period drama and history and am sure that most people can manage to watch and enjoy these shows showing how people looked, acted and dressed during the time that they lived...but producers seem to think a modern audience can't handle that, that we must have modern dialogue that clangs on the ear like a metal trash bin lid, pop music and beachy waves, in order to engage. It would be nice if some of these series were made for adults who go into it wanting to see how life was lived ""back then"" and not some young producer's idea of what would be cool and watchable. I know I am in an age bracket (old) that it not catered to in any way, shape or form ...okay I get it. But most teens are not looking for period drama anyway unless it has time travel, dinosaurs or vampires so they are not the audience for these period dramas anyway. I just watched ""Mr Malcolm's List"" which is a perfectly enjoyable, benign romance/comedy but the idea of Mr. Malcolm taking a young lady to the opera on a ""date"" early on made me laugh out loud and kind of ruined it for me. There is no way in hell any young woman was going on a date with a man or that he would even ask. Unmarried young women often could not even be alone in a room with a brother or cousin, so strict was the division of sexes, without a chaperone. That may be a small point but it tilts the whole of the era being shown. Why bother make it ""period"" at all if you intend to modernize it beyond all recognition? Just make a romantic comedy or drama and be done with it. So many disappointments recently. But this show, and also the latest ""Persusian"" have to be clunkers for sure.",/review/rw8920816/?ref_=tt_urv

","As one of the other reviewers here has noted, part of the function of the epistolary style is that the characters do not make objective narrators, so you have to continually bear that in mind - not everyone is who they seem to be on the surface, and this is the note for YOU, the viewer, not just a plot device for the characters interacting with each other. This also serves in watching the relationships as they develop and the nature of the person you thought you knew is gradually revealed as their past pain is revealed, which in turn shapes their continually developing and changing nature and purpose. The story masterfully takes us on this journey for each of the main characters, and if one of the central themes is secrets - the having, the guarding of, the hunt to discover - we are continually swept along with new - yet hinted at - revelations of secrets of their pasts which shape their present motivations. The dialogue and mental sparring between master manipulators is excellent and faithfully echoes l'esprit du salon. I write this after watching the first six episodes, which I had thought was the total number of the season, and came here to be pleasantly surprised to discover there are three more to go. An excellent, excellent show. The young main actors are very good, and I'm thrilled to see Michael McElhatton in this role.

Ok, the visuals were great! The style is great, all of Triggers shows have really good styles and this show isn't an exception. The animation succeeds in two different; it's probably the most visually funny. For example, in one of the episodes Ryoku is in a hurry and needs to transform as fast as possible (think it was the episode where Satsuki challenges the students and if they would lose they need to quit the school). And by just speeding her transformation animation just a little, they make it look like she's in a hurry and funny. I don't even know if that was supposed to be a joke, but that's one of the many visual gags. They also manage to REALLY make it look like all the powerful are really happening. How the ""camera"" shakes, the air shots away and if something gets an impact you really feel it. Whenever there's a scene in the past, color palette changes and I really like that color palette. I also really liked that whenever a text would come up (for example when someone puts on their Goku suit and they show the name of the suit) sometimes they would interact with them, but not too much so that it becomes fourth wall breaking.

Murder in Suburbia,29 September 2017,jimmullinaux,10," Murder In Suburbia - Highly Recommended!
","This entertaining 2004 British mystery series takes place in the fictional English town of Middleford. Caroline Catz plays Inspector Kate Ashurst and Lisa Faulkner plays Sergeant Emma Scribbins, two well-dressed, wise-cracking, female detectives who must face a variety of grisly murders in the well-manicured suburban homes of Middleford, but who also are facing an unmarried middle age squarely in the mirror. The crimes they solve are clever and bizarre enough to make them interesting, and the suspects are just trendy and snobby enough that you just know they must be Mac users. Kate's romantic subplot centers on her hapless pursuit of their handsome supervisor, Chief Inspector Sullivan, played by Jeremy Sheffield. Emma's love life is a bit more varied with any number of odd sorts, all having dubious qualities. My wife and I have viewed this series many times and find something new and enjoyable with each viewing. Highly recommended!",/review/rw8522744/?ref_=tt_urv

","It doesn't take much of a detective to spot the real criminals: the writers of this show. The lighthearted humor is a little lame. I don't mind that. And Caroline Catz is good enough as an actor. But there is so little depth to the characters, both the two female detectives and their supervisor, that I lost interest midway through the second episode. I thought if the first two episodes were a sign of things to come, better to find something else. Seriously, folks, if anyone (especially a female) has what it takes to be a detective they need to have more on their mind than multiple sex partners and whether to dress like the ""wedding slut"" at their ex's upcoming wedding. What's funny is Catz's boyfriend breaks up with her because all she talks about is murder and he's tired of it. But on the job, all Catz talks about is her boyfriends. So how does she ever catch the perpetrator? Sudden flashes of intuition. And there you have it.

The crimes and the way they are solved are pretty light. Oh, there are enough suspects and during the episode we do our usual guessing, but the situation does not get so tangled up as we have seen in other series where they are constantly dropping red herrings into the mix. The episodes seem to move forward in a natural way, not like some of the things we have watched which seem to be scripted moment to moment. The only frustration part, which is the case in so many series is the amount of adulteries that go on. Is this real life - bed bingo? Oh, one of the episodes had this one character whose bosom was just so obscene looking, it almost looked like she was wearing her butt on her chest.

","Amazing anime trilogy from AKIRA's Katsuhiro Otomo, who presents three unrelated sci fi stories directed by different directors (he did the last one, writers/first-time directors Tensai Okamura and Koji Morimoto did the other two). They are amazing vignettes with some stupendous animation in three different styles. Otomo's is especially unique in that there are no cuts  the ""camera"" moves fluidly through every scene without a jump or a stop. Morimoto's 40-min ""Magnetic Rose"" is stunningly animated, the most amazing of the two, telling of a space ship's investigation of a distress signal discovering a magnificent world created by a woman's memories  the music takes advantage of the operatic aria, Madame Butterfly, arranged by Yoko Kanno, who also supplies an excellent original score. ""Stink Bomb,"" the middle segment, is clever and funny and fast-paced; Otomo's anti-war statement in ""Cannon Fodder"" closes out the film with a subtle bit of thought-provocation about a city whose entire purpose is the firing of cannons at an unknown enemy.",/review/rw8355215/?ref_=tt_urv

Koji Morimoto's ""Magnetic Rose"", Tensai Okamura's ""Stink Bomb"", and Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Cannon Fodder"". I would say that Magnetic rose was perhaps the deepest of these three stores. Offering a beautiful mix of classical music, with a futuristic settings to offer a sense of contrast. Stink Bomb being the more lighthearted of the three. While still maintaining a grim reality, and almost eerie sense of setting, using a more modern day look, and music. Then Cannon Fodder, right from an Orwell idealized future, with the loud sounds, and marches.

Memorîzu,18 September 2006,buffychik,10," An Amazing Vision
","Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Memories"" combines the vision of Otomo's usual ""God's revenge for the human race believing too much in science"" with two first-time, although far from inexperienced directors. The first of the three films, ""Magnetic Rose"" is by far the least Otomo-esquire of the three pieces, although based on one of his short mangas. The film centering mainly on the sci-fi side of anime. Space freighters respond to a distress call in a bad sector of space, and become lost in the haunting memories of an intergalactic opera singer. The second piece, ""Stink Bomb"" shows, if possible, a humorous side to biological warfare, as an unsuspecting pharmaceutical tech accidentally ingests a biological weapon and becomes a walking disaster. The final film, actually directed by Otomo, called ""Cannon Fodder"" was by far my favorite, and the most disturbing of the three films. The basic story centers around a family living in a town whose citizens devote their entire lives to bombing an unseen enemy in the sky. This story is very politically motivated, very dark, and not at all a ""happy little story"". The animation is unlike anything I've ever seen from Otomo, and full of sweeping single-cut shots that give you chills. Overall, I highly recommend this movie collection for any anime fan. It most definitely incorporates the vision of three brilliant directors.",/review/rw8355215/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had long suspected that the American geeky infatuation with Japanese animation (aka Japanimation or anime) stemmed from the same impulses that veered Western Intellectuals into the Eastern Mystical religions. To me, anime was merely the new name for the poorly animated cartoons that proliferated in this country back in the 1960s wave of cartoons that began with such fare as Gigantor the Space Age Robot, Kimba the White Lion, & Speed Racer. By the 80s & 90s the filmic equivalents had spawned such 'classics' like Akira, & Princess Mononoke. I was wrong. it is heartening to see a film of such daring, even when it fails, getting made & released in Japan, as well frustrating to note that no American animators would dare pick up the gauntlet this film drops- opting instead for numbingly simpleminded Disney fare, which is far more like the watered down Mysticism I expected from this anime film. Instances like this are those times I love being proved wrong. In fact, I only hope my artistic presumptions are more routinely proved wrong.
